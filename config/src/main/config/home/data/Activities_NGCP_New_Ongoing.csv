DI100100014,2009,2010,'To wake them up again': Digital futures for the international diaspora of early ethnographic collections from Arnhem Land,"Drawing on my experience as a Yolngu elder with research expertise in Curatorial Studies, this project will assess historical materials from Arnhem Land held by museums in Europe, the USA and Australia. Dating from 1924, these materials collected by Wilkins, Webb, Warner, Elkin and Berndt include the oldest ethnographic records of Yolngu culture in Arnhem Land. My explorations of these materials will refer to the continuing traditional frameworks that guide community life in Arnhem Land. I will also evaluate the impact of international relations and digital technologies in addressing needs for sustained remote Indigenous community access to such materials, and bring the voices of contemporary elders from Arnhem Land to bear on these issues.",The University of Sydney,Dr Joseph N Gumbula,NSW
DI100100088,2009,2010,Closing the educational gap for Aboriginal primary students in low density schools: A qualitative analysis of impact of culturally inclusive pedagogy,"Aboriginal students remain the most educationally disadvantaged Australians. Culturally inclusive pedagogy is widely assumed to improve Aboriginal students’ educational achievement & success but its actual impact remains untested. This research seeks to capitalise on cutting-edge interdisciplinary theory & research & an innovative & robust qualitative research design to elucidate the impact of specific facets of culturally inclusive pedagogy on Aboriginal students’ educational outcomes & well-being in low density schools where most Aboriginal students experience schooling. This will result in building the capacity of Aboriginal Education, strengthening schooling & pedagogy for Aboriginal students, and contribute to closing the gap.",University of Western Sydney,Ms Virginia G O'Rourke; Prof Rhonda G Craven; A/Prof Geoffrey E Munns; Dr Gawaian H Bodkin-Andrews,NSW
DI100100113,2009,2010,Wingara Mangami (to follow the dream of understanding): Seeding innovative intervention success to challenge and pracism for Inyouth,"Racism towards Indigenous youth is a pervasive problem with long-term adverse psychosocial consequences for Australia. Research has demonstrated that racism impacts upon the mental health, life potential and educational outcomes of Indigenous Australians. Grounded on cutting-edge interdisciplinary theory and research, and as a logical and necessary progression of my successful ARC funded development of research-derived intervention strategies I will: explicate psychosocial determinants/consequences of racism; implement an innovative new intervention and test its impact on pro-social behaviours, mental health, wellbeing and academic functioning of Indigenous secondary students using a powerful longitudinal design and multi-method analyses.",University of Western Sydney,Dr Gawaian H Bodkin-Andrews; Prof Rhonda G Craven,NSW
DI100100130,2009,2010,"Developing predictive tools for rapid assessment of multiple impacts, including climate change, on the marine ecosystem of Torres Strait (Australia)","Australia's unique marine biodiversity and significant economic wealth generated from marine systems are particularly vulnerable to the threat of climate change and other anthropogenic threats. Currently, the science needed to manage the synergistic effects of multiple threats lags far behind our current knowledge of the biophysical components of marine ecosystems. We will develop tools to link threats and ecosystem processes to predict the impact that exposure has on marine life. This will provide an understanding of the strategies that can be applied to protect biodiversity, increase resilience of marine ecosystems, and provide sustained cultural and economic benefit for Australian communities under climate and environmental change.",James Cook University,Ms Cass M Hunter; Dr James R Butler; Mr Timothy D Skewes; Mr David T Brewer; Dr Vincent Lyne; Prof Stephen M Turton,Qld
DI100100145,2009,2010,"Through travellers' eyes: Foreign observations of Aboriginal people and British colonisation, 1800-1850",This project critically examines encounters between travellers and Aboriginal people throughout Australia in the first half of the nineteenth century. It examines how these encounters affected the Western travellers' engagement with Victorian anthropological thought and provoked criticism of British imperialism. Aboriginal history will benefit from a more complex picture of nineteenth-century ideas about Aborigines. I will highlight diverse critiques of settler-colonialism which were not limited to Christian or humanitarian concerns. ,The Australian National University,Dr Shino A Konishi; Prof Ann Curthoys; Prof Stephen R Garton; Prof Ann M McGrath,ACT

",This project will identify the chronic multigenerational response of an iconic oyster species to ocean acidification (OA) & temperature. Already acute studies have found impacts of OA & temperature on the reproduction & development of oysters with selectively bred oyster populations being resilient. We have no information internationally on the impact of long term exposure to OA & temperature on marine organisms & ecosystems. We will use chronic multigenerational experiments to identify whether populations of the Sydney rock oyster have the potential to adapt to OA & temperature. Our goal is to determine how the Australian oyster industry will be affected by climate change & develop strategies for the sustainability of marine ecosystems.,University of Western Sydney,Ms Laura M Parker; A/Prof Pauline M Ross; A/Prof David A Raftos; Dr Wayne A O'Connor; Prof Dr Hans O Portner,NSW

DP1092437,2009,2010,Friction-based modelling of the dynamics of nanoconfined fluid mixtures,"This project aims to make groundbreaking theoretical advances in our understanding of the transport of fluid mixtures through nanosized pores. This will involve the integration of two critical factors: interactions between molecules within the fluid, and between them and the nanopore walls. Underpinned by simulation and experiments on the transport rates of targeted gases and their mixtures through key nanomaterials, the theoretical work in the project will deliver a powerful approach for predicting dynamic behaviour. This will enable the optimal process design of a wide range of emerging nanotechnologies, such as membrane separations and kinetic molecular sieving, catalysis, fuel cells, nanofluidics and lab-on-a-chip technology.",The University of Queensland,Prof SK Bhatia; Prof D Nicholson; Prof Dr J Kaerger,Qld
DP1092442,2009,2010,Neural mechanisms of attention in the honeybee and Drosophila melanogaster,"How does the brain operate to allow animals to attend to salient cues within the complex natural world?  To address this question, we propose the use of two model systems, namely the honeybee and the fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  We will address how neurons (excitable nerve cells) and neural networks change their responses to attended visual cues.  We will investigate how brain activity correlates with attention in the bee and subsequently manipulate this activity using genetic tools in Drosophila to pinpoint the mechanisms underlying attention.   The proposed research addresses how attention operates on the level of neurons and neural networks in awake, behaving animals to expand our understanding of the neural mechanisms of attention.",The University of Queensland,Dr AC Paulk,Qld

The research outcomes will be enhanced fundamental knowledge and understanding of key developmental processes in this key pathogen. This will construct a solid foundation for the development new methods of intervention against pathogens. This is crucial, given the major problems with drug resistance in endoparasites of livestock.",The University of Melbourne,Prof RB Gasser; Prof PW Sternberg; Dr AC Loukas,Vic
DP1092445,2009,2010,"Technology and behavioural evolution in late Pleistocene Africa, Europe and Australia","The project tests competing models of human behavioural evolution in the late Pleistocene, using assemblages of stone artefacts from Africa, Europe and Australia. The project has two components. The first involves using finely-resolved technological and palaeoecological data from African sites to assess whether the capacity of humans to develop technological solutions to environmental variation changed significantly over the last 120 000 years. The second examines whether the technologies which appeared at this time were crucial to the human colonisation of new environments in Europe and Australia after 60 000 years. The project will result in a reappraisal of human behavioural evolution.",The Australian National University,Prof P Hiscock; Mr AC Mackay; Dr BM Chase,ACT
DP1092458,2009,2010,Design of reactive foils for joining amorphous alloys,"Amorphous alloys are very promising materials for many technological applications because of their extraordinary properties that include high strength, toughness, corrosion resistance etc. However, amorphous alloys are very restricted in application by the inability to join them readily to make larger assemblies. Conventional methods do not work because of the high cooling rates required to maintain amorphousness. This research, which consists of novel experimental and computational components, investigates highly reactive foils for the purposes of joining amorphous alloys. It is anticipated that the research will lay the foundation for a robust and reliable means for joining these materials and facilitate their uptake in technology.

DP1092464,2009,2010,Designing software for secrecy: Security-enabled program algebra,"Bad software design is the direct cause of many security breaches in computer systems. Security is a contemporary issue of the highest importance because of the pervasive access offered by the web: a system's user population is no longer limited or legislated; rather it is unknown, widely distributed and possibly hostile.



This research builds on our major theoretical breakthrough in software analysis which has the potential to allow software security properties to be accurately defined and analysed. It will lead to the creation of new smart technology for designing and implementing resilient software, mathematically proven to withstand hostile attacks.

DP1092465,2009,2010,Understanding how reproduction and sexual conflict drive sex-dependent longevity and ageing,"Despite a great deal of success explaining the broad mechanisms and evolutionary processes that influence ageing, we still know very little about why males and females differ in lifespan and in how they age. Such differences may be due to the profound differences between males and females in how they invest in reproduction as well as to conflict between males and females over reproduction and the constraints of sharing a genome. I will study how reproduction and sexual conflict lead both to oxidative damage to macromolecules and to trade-offs between current and future reproduction. This will provide the most complete integration to date of mechanistic and evolutionary evidence for why the sexes age differently.",The University of New South Wales,Prof RC Brooks,NSW
DP1092466,2009,2010,Characterisation of the novel mitochondrial protein (CABC1/ADCK3) and its role in protecting against oxidative stress,"The specific defect being investigated here is in a mitochondrial protein CABC1/ADCK3. Mutations in the gene coding for this protein have been shown to be associated with a novel human genetic disorder. The aim here is to characterise the protein and investigate its function with a view to elucidating the connection between defects in mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and the appearance of oxidative stress. A greater understanding of this protein, its cellular localization and activity will assist in delineating its normal role in the cell to protect against neurological abnormalities.

This project aims to develop and apply novel tree ring technologies for linking biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients to long-term forest productivity in different regions, and to test hypotheses that long-term forest productivity in different regions respond differently to GCC and historical episodes, and that improved understanding of environmental fingerprints of the biogeochemical cycles embedded in tree rings can be used to account for long-term forest productivity and carbon stocks at different scales in response to future GCC.",Griffith University,Prof Z Xu; Prof R Oren; Prof S Linder; Prof T Drouet; Prof X Shao; Prof Q Zhang; Prof CE Johnson; Prof Z Cai; Prof Y Zhu; Dr C Chen; Dr SE Boyd,Qld
DP1092474,2009,2010,Reform of the Personal Liability of Directors for Unpaid Employee Entitlements,"Laws imposing liability on corporate directors must balance responsible governance by directors and the need for appropriate compensation for affected parties with the risk of inhibiting directors' legitimate commercial decision-making. A pressing issue is the extent to which directors should be liable for unpaid employee entitlements, given the ineffectiveness of the relevant Corporations Act provisions and the burden this places on taxpayers. This project will examine other models of liability, which provide greater deterrence and possible compensation, including incentives to place companies into voluntary administration. The objective is to recommend reform of the employee entitlement provisions. ",Monash University,Dr HL Anderson,Vic
DP1092483,2009,2010,Laboratory and Theoretical Investigation of Soft Clay Behaviour under Cyclic Loading Stabilised by Prefabricated Vertical Drains,"Soft and yielding coastal clays often hamper the development of transportation infrastructure including embankments that are subjected to cyclic loads.  The use of prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) can ensure sufficient drainage of soft clays by rapid pore pressure dissipation, thereby increasing the soil strength and minimising post-construction deformation. The main aim is to understand the intricate behaviour of soft soil under cyclic loading stabilised by PVD to control excess pore pressure generation and associated settlement and lateral soil movement. The outcome will be reduced construction and maintenance costs. Laboratory and field studies utilising computer modelling will result in improved design concepts and guidelines.",University of Wollongong,Prof BN Indraratna; Dr C Rujikiatkamjorn; Dr MD Liu; Dr J Chu,NSW

It aims to provide the first comprehensive set of detailed measurements in turbulent flames containing soot, building on a recent breakthrough in temperature measurement using advanced laser diagnostics. These data will be used to provide new understanding, guide the development of models and allow their rigorous validation over a wide range of conditions. The research will contribute to reduced pollutant emissions and increased performance of industrial combustion systems, allow optimisation of carbon nano-particle production and increase the capacity to model fires.",The University of Adelaide,Prof GJ Nathan; A/Prof BB Dally; Prof H Pitsch,SA
DP1092489,2009,2010,To investigate the role of the protein kinase SMG-1 in the stress response,A variety of mechanisms are available to cells to respond to DNA damage and other forms of stress. The protein kinase SMG-1 plays several roles in protecting cells against a variety of stresses. The overall aim is to employ a mutant mouse model of Smg-1 to investigate its role in the stress response. We have generated a knockout mutant mouse for SMG-1 and described an emerging phenotype in carriers of the mutant gene (Smg-1+/-).Furthermore this important resource will be used in strategic crosses with other mouse mutants in separate or overlapping pathways in the stress response. This project is significant in that it describes a novel approach to investigating the role of a specific protein involved in the stress response.,The University of Queensland,Prof MF Lavin; Dr TL Roberts,Qld
DP1092490,2009,2010,Draining the will for peace or war: Understanding how social influence and self-regulation processes interact in conflict,"Conflict is common, whether between racial, religious, and political groups, or between businesses and firms. Yet conflict frays tempers, wastes time, costs money, and hurts people. Destructive conflict escalation may occur despite rational plans and good intentions. This process is poorly understood. Recently motivation researchers discovered that tasks requiring willpower drain the resources individuals have available for other challenges, a state called 'ego-depletion'. The present research will improve our understanding of how good intentions fail and conflict escalates. It will do so by studying the impact of ego-depletion in decreasing adherence to internalised social rules, or norms, and increasing reactivity to situational cues.",The University of Queensland,Dr WR Louis; Dr JR Smith; Dr KD Vohs,Qld

Australia has always been a significant participant in International Criminal Justice, contributing to the development of the legal, political and social issues associated with ICJ. Australia's security, as well as its standing in the international community will continue to be directly affected by the way it understands and applies ICJ. This project will critically analyse and assess the role, nature and impact of ICJ on Australia, make an important contribution to academic work and impact on policy development in this area.",Monash University,Dr GJ Boas; Prof W Schabas; Prof MP Scharf,Vic
DP1092492,2009,2010,Understanding the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection,"Pathogenic viruses that rely on insects for transmission between hosts cause many serious diseases in plants and animals. Understanding antiviral responses in insects is critical for strategies aimed at controlling insect virus transmission. We recently demonstrated that insects infected with the extremely common bacteria, Wolbachia are substantially protected from pathogenic viruses. This project will investigate the mechanisms that drive Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection. This knowledge will significantly advance our understanding of control of virus infection in insects and will facilitate programs to control virus disease.",The University of Queensland,Dr KN Johnson; Prof SL O'Neill; Dr JC Brownlie,Qld

DP1092501,2009,2010,Creation of a non-venomous honey bee,"Bees are responsible for more deaths of Australians than sharks, snakes and spiders. Our goal is to make a bee that has a less dangerous sting, using two approaches. We aim to mutate the gene for phospholipase A2, the main allergen in the venom of the honey bee using a technique that induces a natural mutation, but does not otherwise modify the bee's genome. Secondly, we will make transgenic bees that express a programmed cell death protease in their venom cells, driven by the promoter for melittin, the main protein component of bee venom.",La Trobe University,Prof DL Vaux,Vic

DP1092507,2009,2010,The distortion of eyewitness identification testimony,"Criminal justice systems in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States rely on eyewitness identification testimony to determine the guilt of defendants. Yet eyewitness memory experiments, cases of mistaken identity and DNA exonerations have shown that this testimony can be easily and profoundly distorted by social influences. Our project tests when, how and why eyewitness identification testimony can be so profoundly distorted, providing a theoretical explanation that leads to better understanding of the processes involved in optimising the reliability of evidence from witnesses and suggesting practical reforms in the collection of eyewitness evidence.

DP1092508,2009,2010,"A new improved solution to global optimization over multivariate polynomials: Mathematical principles, numerical methods and selected applications","Optimization is a commonly used technology in industry and scientific disciplines to find locally ""best"" solutions for their problems. Problems involving polynomials may have numerous locally best solutions that are not globally best.  How to find globally best solutions of these problems has become a critical question world-wide, and  is essential to improving  performance. Yet, there are no known criteria for identifying such solutions. This project will provide a new methodology, capable of determining the mathematical principles for the identification of globally best solutions, develop reliable methods for finding these solutions, and produce algorithms for use in applications such as localization problems in wireless sensor networks.",The University of New South Wales,Prof V Jeyakumar; Prof G Lee; Prof B Mordukhovich; Prof S Kim; Dr G Li,NSW

DP1092523,2009,2010,A Principled Theory of Legal Interpretation,"This project extends a recent, innovative approach in philosophy of language to provide an analysis of the meaning of statements of law. Law is a very important area of discourse. Yet it is one that few philosophers of language have explored, and which gives rise to distinctive interpretive issues that orthodox approaches in philosophy of language are unable to resolve. Developed appropriately, the innovative approach that we adopt - a speech-act theoretic approach - is able to resolve those issues. Because the project results in a novel and philosophically sound theory of legal interpretation, and uses that theory to resolve controversies in Australian constitutional law, it also makes a major contribution to legal theory and practice.",Monash University,Prof JD Goldsworthy; Dr DA Smith; Dr PC Emerton; Dr SJ Barker; Mr RE Ekins,Vic

DP1092526,2009,2010,"Youth and violence: Occurrence, epidemiology and function","This study will examine appetitive violence, an emerging problem in young offenders. Appetitive violence is similar to instrumental violence, in that it is proactive; it differs because it is associated with a positive emotional state and has social-emotional, rather than tangible objectives. Media reports suggest appetitive violence is alarmingly common. However, no empirical scrutiny of this type of violence exists. This study will explore the psychological characteristics of youth who engage in appetitive violence and their performance following release from custody. Key outcomes will include the identification of treatment needs necessary for effective programming and enhanced risk assessment for statutory releasing authorities.",Monash University,Dr MD Daffern; Dr SD Thomas,Vic

The emotion of disgust may represent one such avoidance system.  Our project aims to test this assertion by examining novel predictions derived from it, which span development, cognition, motivation, immunology, health, cultural differences and morality. Infectious disease is now being recognised as a key force in shaping human culture, behaviour and biology. The significance of this project is in establishing the role of disgust in this evolutionary account. Apart from contributing to this important debate, a further outcome is in understanding how disgust can be used to improve human health, with respect to hygiene, risky sexual behaviour and stigmatisation.",Macquarie University,A/Prof RJ Stevenson; Dr TI Case; Dr DM Hodgson; Dr MJ Oaten,NSW

DP1092815,2009,2010,Hiroshima and Here: A Cultural History of Australian Responses to Nuclear War and Weaponry,"This project provides the first comprehensive survey and analysis of atomic culture in Australia. Since the destruction of Hiroshima in August 1945 through to today's global nuclear dilemma, Australian cultural responses to nuclear weapons have been prolific and diverse, ranging from polemical journalism to fiction, poetry, film, the performing and visual arts, and the rituals and rhetoric of 'no nuke' protest. Yet this collective body of expression lies neglected, awaiting discovery. Resulting in a major monograph, essays and related research, this project mines the rich lode of national nuclear representation, expanding the critical terrain of Australian culture on a subject of compelling local and international significance.",Monash University,A/Prof RC Gerster,Vic
DP1092819,2009,2010,Words from the sand: A lexical analysis of early Greek papyri from Egypt,"The discovery of the ancient Greek papyri from Egypt has opened a remarkable window on our deep human past. Every scrap of papyrus extracted from the Egyptian sand has the potential to change the way we think about some aspect of ancient culture. This project addresses a fundamental problem affecting all research into the material: our incomplete and unsatisfactory understanding of the vocabulary of these fragile textual artefacts renders a vast amount of evidence uncertain and its significance therefore ambiguous. Innovative methodologies will produce a state of the art lexical analysis of early Greek papyri, offering a key contribution to the larger study of the Greek vocabulary as a whole.",Macquarie University,Dr TV Evans; Dr JA Lee; Dr JK Aitken,NSW

This project applies my own 'know how' in the field of melt inclusion studies and state-of-the-art microanalytical techniques to directly address relationships between compositions of primary melts of small and large volume continental magmas, such as kimberlites and flood basalts, and their respective deep sources in the Earth. Major, trace and volatile element compositions of continental melts will add to understanding of possible 'recycled' crustal components and their role in creating non-peridotitic mantle reservoirs.",University of Tasmania,Prof V Kamenetsky,Tas
DP1092829,2009,2010,Lipid and Carbohydrate Based Systems to Target and Deliver Peptide Drug Candidates to Specific Cells,"Many peptide-based compounds have been identified as potential new drugs and vaccines but few have progressed into the clinic, due to lack of oral absorption and rapid enzymatic breakdown. Our project will address these issues employing a highly novel strategy involving naturally occurring sugars and lipids. Our delivery system which contains a carbohydrate-based targeting unit will be conjugated to the peptide/lipopeptide of interest (drug or vaccine candidate) using chemical and enzymatic methods. Most importantly this proof of principle approach has the potential to not only improve the drug bioavailability, but to also enhance the access to the target sites.

The aim of the project is to formulate and solve new and important mathematical problems, which lie in the background of modern cryptography. They are also of independent value for pure mathematics and will stimulate new approaches to and points of view on classical results and methods. The main outcome will be making conceptual advances in this area and develop a new theoretic platform for studying major cryptosystems and underlying problems, such as integers factorisation, inverting of the RSA map and the discrete logarithm problem.",Macquarie University,Prof I Shparlinski,NSW

Despite the impact on victims, the frequency of violence, seemingly high rates of reoffending, and the prevalence of mental disorder amongst perpetrators, no validated methods for assessing or managing stalkers exist. This project will be the first to evaluate a structured risk assessment tool for stalkers and develop a psychological treatment programme to reduce violence and reoffending amongst high risk stalkers. It will provide evidence-based practical strategies for managing stalkers, reducing the social and financial burden of stalking behaviour on victims and the community.",Monash University,Prof JR Ogloff; Prof PE Mullen; Dr TE McEwan; Dr MD Daffern; Dr RD MacKenzie,Vic

No consensus exists about what the cognitive abilities were of Neanderthals, nor whether the emergence of modern human anatomy is related to the origins of complex behaviour. We will use optical dating to construct a highly resolved calibrated timescale for the period 160 to 50 thousand years ago for archaeological assemblages associated with Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens in France, Morocco and South Africa. This will facilitate direct comparisons of the behaviour of two human species in discrete geographic regions, and thereby test current models for the origins and development of behavioural complexity.",University of Wollongong,Dr Z Jacobs; Prof HL Dibble; Prof J Hublin; Dr SP McPherron,NSW

Methane hydrate represents a potential source of clean energy, while formation of carbon dioxide hydrate can be utilised as an alternative carbon sequestration technology and an alternative water desalination process. The fundamentals of the processes associated with gas hydrate formation and dissociation remain unclear, posing an impediment to technology development for methane extraction and hydrate utilisation. This project will improve fundamental understanding of the sub-processes of hydrate formation and decomposition on a molecular level and, on the basis of which, develop an advanced kinetic model of foam-based processes of gas hydrate formation.

The specific rooting pattern must run parallel with evolution of specific cell and tissue types, each of which might be singularly effective in a particular habitat. My principal research goal is therefore to investigate the detailed structure and functioning of different classes of root, combining state-of-the-art single-cell and field-based techniques with traditional methods based on anatomy and physiology.

This project will study a unique exception - the sheared margins of the Gulf of California in Mexico that are actively forming today and superbly exposed.  Key questions concerning the role and mechanisms of heat input to the crust during margin formation will be examined and used to test and constrain theoretical models. The implications will be used to develop a clearer understanding of the evolution of older sheared margins in Australia and elsewhere.",The University of Melbourne,Prof AJ Gleadow; A/Prof BP Kohn; Dr JM Fletcher; Prof TM Harrison; A/Prof PW Reiners,Vic
DP1092868,2009,2010,Choice experiments to improve predictive power for policy makers,"Choice experiments are used extensively by decision makers to predict the potential public benefit of proposed policy changes. However, often the choice experiment used only allows for the estimation of parameters in a main effects model. When this model is inappropriate, typically because of the existence of interaction terms, the parameters are biased and inaccurate predictions can result. The reason that decision makers use these designs is that appropriate designs for the estimation of more complicated models are not available. This project will construct suitable designs for these models, thus leading to more accurate predictions and better decision making.","University of Technology, Sydney",Prof DJ Street; A/Prof DM Donovan,NSW

Copulation and internal fertilization in modern mammals were thought to be independently evolved in sharks, but our new evidence questions this. New techniques developed by us for extracting and investigating fossilized soft tissues in three dimensions have already demonstrated preserved embryos in several extinct groups. Exciting new fossil localities in central Australia and China are producing the oldest known vertebrates with jaws and hard skeletons. Our project will integrate the fossil and molecular clock data to document these major evolutionary innovations, and investigate the idea that internal fertilization originated as jaws first evolved.

DP1092897,2009,2010,Sexual conflict in the mitochondrion,"When it comes to sex, the best-interests of males and females are often in conflict. Much attention has focused on the genetics underlying sexual conflict. However, the role that the mitochondrion plays in promoting such conflict has been neglected. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited, reaching a dead-end in males. Mutations in mtDNA that increase female reproductive success (hence the transmission rate of mtDNA) will be evolutionary favoured, even if these same mutations impair male success. Such mutations may thus fuel sexually antagonistic co-evolution between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Using robust experimentation to explore this idea, this project stands at the cutting-edge in evolutionary biology. ",Monash University,Dr DK Dowling,Vic

Polymorphic species with multiple discrete colour forms exemplify extreme diversity. A major, unresolved controversy is whether evolutionary processes maintaining colour polymorphisms within species can generate diversity between species (speciation). This project takes advantage of remarkable variation in male throat coloration in the South Australian tawny dragon lizard to resolve this issue. This will be achieved by combining two traditionally separate research approaches 1) identifying macro-evolutionary patterns at both the population and species level and 2) elucidating micro-evolutionary processes within individuals and populations.

This project will test this hypothesis by analysing the regulatory strategies of health ombudsmen in two Australian states (New South Wales and Queensland), and the responses by hospitals to ombudsmen resolutions of patients' complaints. It will examine whether undertakings by hospitals to improve the quality of their services are implemented, and whether softer regulatory strategies (informal procedures) are more likely to produce such changes than harder strategies (formal procedures). The study will make a significant contribution to regulatory theory and to promoting health system responsiveness and accountability to the public.",The Australian National University,A/Prof JM Healy; A/Prof MM Walton; Prof JB Braithwaite,ACT
DP1093049,2009,2010,Unlocking archives of faunal dispersal and extinction: the key to reconstructing palaeoenvironmental change in Southeast Asia,"Widespread environmental change, caused by variable climatic conditions in the last 500,000 years, enticed fauna (and humans) into Southeast Asia, resulting in faunal turnovers and extinctions. The exact timing of these major events is uncertain because a lack of dating applications has meant that the age of many of the key fossil sites is not known. The analysis of well-preserved cave breccia (rock with angular fragments and bone) is the key to rectifying this chronological impasse. Using novel methods for dating and tooth identification, we will determine the age of key fossil breccia sites in Southeast Asia to establish the timing of faunal migration and provide fresh insights into the role of Asia in the dispersal of humans.",Macquarie University,Dr KE Westaway; Prof MJ Morwood; Dr GD van den Bergh; Prof G Shen; Dr RM Bailey,NSW

DP1093086,2009,2010,Relativistic jets and radio-mode feedback in massive galaxies,"Supermassive black holes lie at the heart of all large galaxies. When a black hole swallows infalling gas, it can generate relativistic radio jets which inject huge amounts of energy into the surrounding galaxy and prevent gas clouds from cooling and forming new stars. This may explain one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology: why did massive galaxies stop forming new stars at least 7 billion years ago?  We will  measure the ages and luminosities of the radio sources in massive galaxies and estimate the energy injected by radio jets over the past nine billion years of cosmic time. Our work will provide a decisive test of whether this radio-mode feedback is the missing ingredient in our current understanding of galaxy formation.

DP1093230,2009,2010,Understanding the ecological resilience of nearshore marine communities,"Understanding the resilience of natural ecosystems to disturbances is emerging as a central focus of marine ecology, especially adaptation to climate change.  Overall resilience depends on the responses of a few key species, often those that provide habitat for other species - the ecosystem engineers.  Resilience has been hypothesized to be spatially heterogeneous, and depend on the extent of ecosystem modification, and connectivity between local populations, but few empirical test of these hypotheses exist.  I will focus on two major temperate marine ecosystems and their engineers.  I will determine which, if any, of the current mechanisms underpinning resilience operate in these systems.

Compounds that compete for these receptors have been developed into blockbuster drugs, but most such GPCRs are under-exploited as drug targets due to uncertainties about their structures, ligand binding sites and intracellular signalling pathways. This project will speed up discovery of compounds that regulate GPCRs by developing and validating a new approach that comparatively matches hot spots shared in GPCRs to common ligand fragments that bind them.

DP1093287,2009,2010,The structural biology of light capture: A molecular resolution 3D atlas of the photosynthetic machinery,"AIM: To produce a pseudo-atomic 3D-atlas of the photosynthetic machinery of microalgae.

SIGNIFICANCE: Photosynthesis drives the first step of all biofuel production processes by capturing solar energy and converting it to chemical energy.  In excess, light can however cause photodamage. Microalgae have therefore evolved complex photo-protection mechanisms. These can dissipate ('waste'), up to 90% of the captured light energy as fluorescence and heat. It has been demonstrated that reducing the size of the light harvesting antenna can considerably increase photosynthetic efficiency. 

OUTCOME: This 3D atlas will facilitate the fine tuning of the photosynthetic machinery for high efficiency 2nd generation bio-fuel production.

However honey bees do not fit well in Darwin's theory, as it is sterility, which is promoted. Inhibition of ovary development is partly induced by exposure to queen pheromones. Recently, the discovery of a mutant line of honey bees in which worker bees lay eggs at high frequency showed that a genetic component is implicated.

Strong boundary currents critically link the global climate with nursery regions, controlling nutrient upwelling from offshore waters limiting coastal productivity. Equal nutrient fluxes may be driven by smaller-scale coastal forcing, including sea-breezes and wave-driven flows. Small, active reefs could thus be important in driving productivity, but their regional impact has not been quantified. We will estimate which physical driver is more important as a controller of productivity on the continental shelf.

In this proposal we will use structural biology and biochemical approaches to study how a novel class of molecules, 'foldamers', interact with protein partners. Foldamers are peptides containing non-natural amino acids (e.g. beta-amino acids) with discrete folding propensities. They are more stable than natural peptides and can bind their targets with high affinity. Hence, they may provide a useful alternative to traditional small organic molecule drugs. We will gain new insights into how foldamers bind their targets and how they might be developed into a new class of reagents for disrupting protein complexes, and perhaps even drugs.",The University of Melbourne,Dr PM Colman; Dr BJ Smith; Dr WD Fairlie,Vic

However, most Web services are human-oriented and not automated. As a result, this hampers the use of Web services in complex business contexts. To provide a complete solution to this problem, a suitable framework is needed to declaratively describe the components for accomplishing various Web Services. This project aims to fundamentally extend the capabilities of current technologies for describing and reasoning about Web information, in particular, Web services. It will significantly contribute towards Australia's leading role in the cutting edge research of intelligent systems development, and powerful new Web-based applications can be used by Australian industry and society.",Griffith University,A/Prof K Wang; Dr JR Thornton; Dr J Wang; Prof T Eiter; Prof G Antoniou; Dr H Tompits,Qld
DP1093654,2009,2010,Promoting intergroup forgiveness: The benefits and pitfalls of apologies and invocations of shared humanity,"Even after an intergroup conflict ends, the legacy of destruction can lay the seeds for future conflicts. This cycle can be broken if the different parties decide not only to negotiate but also to forgive. The proposed research will critically examine two strategies for facilitating intergroup forgiveness: (1) the delivery of intergroup apologies, and (2) the invoking of a shared human identity. The studies examine not just when and why they work, but when and why they might be expected to backfire.  As such, the project will make significant advances in social psychological theorizing about the pre-conditions for intergroup forgiveness. The studies will also help identify specific, concrete strategies for promoting reconciliation.",The University of Queensland,A/Prof MJ Hornsey; Dr MJ Wohl,Qld

DP1093700,2009,2010,Working against type:  Stereotype threat effects on mature age workers,Mature age workers are often stereotyped as less competent than their younger colleagues.  A mature age worker who is aware of these societal stereotypes may experience 'stereotype threat' - anxiety about the possibility of confirming the negative stereotypes.  Stereotype threat disrupts performance and leads to lower motivation and general disengagement.  This project's conceptual framework identifies the contextual cues that are likely to evoke stereotype threat in a mature age jobseeker or employee.  The project's aim is to identify individual factors that make some workers particularly vulnerable to stereotype threat and to identify organisational factors that mitigate stereotype threat effects.    ,University of South Australia,Prof C Kulik,SA

How should they adjust this to suit changes in their environment? Sex allocation underpins the reproductive success of every sexual organism, yet we know little of how it evolves to optimize reproduction in hermaphroditic animals (e.g., corals and clams). This is despite their ubiquity in nature, especially in the sea, and the development of theory explicit to their mating system.

We propose a strategy using the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster to investigate a novel hypothesis: that synaptic release is the primary target mechanism of general anaesthetics, and that synaptic coordination and whole-brain coherence is the target process of these drugs. We will design strategic mutations in the synaptic release machinery to modulate anaesthesia phenotypes, which will be screened behaviourally and then characterized by electrophysiology. By manipulating synaptic function in the anaesthetized fly brain we will be directly addressing how local effects at synapses translate to global brain phenomena such as loss of perception.",The University of Queensland,Dr B van Swinderen,Qld

DP1094010,2009,2010,A new class of statistical methods for analysing long memory time series models with heteroskedasticity,"This project will develop new methods of statistical inference for economic and financial time series that exhibit both long memory and heteroskedasticity. Long memory means economic shocks take a long time for their full effect to be felt. Heteroskedasticity means variability changes over time, eg. periods of calm are followed by periods of volatility. While both long memory and heteroskedasticity are commonly found to co-exist in economic time series, there are almost no suitable inference methods. In this research, we will develop a suite of methods for the analysis of long memory that are robust and/or efficient in the presence of heteroskedasticity, and that are applicable in empirically relevant sample sizes.",The University of Melbourne,A/Prof DC Harris; Dr HY Kew,Vic

BECs share many features of superconductors: they flow without resistance and only rotate by forming tiny quantum tornadoes.  This proposal will develop a new theory needed to describe the dynamics of how BECs form, decay, and reach steady-state.  We will also design and perform experiments to test and refine our theoretical predictions.  Understanding the dynamics of BECs will provide insights to other important problems: the properties of turbulence in fluids, the nature of condensates in semiconductors, and how phase transitions occur and their relation to the birth of the universe.",The University of Queensland,A/Prof MJ Davis; Dr PB Blakie; A/Prof BP Anderson,Qld

DP1094034,2009,2010,Minority hostility and resistance: The interplay between majority rejection and minority goals,"The reluctance of immigrants and other minority groups to integrate in the host society is often perceived as the cause of intergroup tension. In the proposed research we examine the opposite prediction. We propose that hostility and rejection of societal norms arises because of the very attempts of minority group members to gain full acceptance into the host society. When these attempts are thwarted due to majority rejection, minorities may become hostile and radicalise. Whereas previous research has examined either the minority or the majority perspective, we focus on the dynamic interplay between minorities and majorities as a key factor in the emergence of social unrest in modern day societies.",The University of Queensland,Prof J Jetten; Prof N Ellemers,Qld

The forces that cause plate tectonics can break continents apart, with rifts systems that occasionally propagate through very old and cold continental plates. Nonetheless, classical models fail to predict breakup of old continents. We have developed a new dynamic theory, where the heat generated by deformation can significantly reduce the strength of plates. We propose to apply this theory to the dynamic strength of continents, adding potential weakening through magmatism and systematically analyse rift systems. This will overhaul the way we model continental deformation.",The University of Western Australia,Prof Dr K Regenauer-Lieb; Dr RF Weinberg; Dr G Rosenbaum; Prof G Manatschal,WA

Responding to climate change requires the effective management of carbon, in all its forms, to promote reductions in atmospheric emissions. The existing legal framework, established in the nineteenth century, is inappropriate for this purpose as it lacks consistency and coherence, across the jurisdictions, in its treatment of the rights and responsibilities associated with carbon.

It will be innovative in bridging the fields of Australian politics/political history and the study and uses of history in Australian public life. It will explore how federal politicians have read and thought about histories, both Australian and international, and have themselves popularised certain understandings of historical episodes in political and therefore persuasive contexts. It will provide an excellent foundation for further research into Australian political culture and the significance of history in public life.",Deakin University,Prof DM Lowe; Prof JA Walter,Vic
DP1094119,2009,2010,Defining in molecular terms cis-inhibition as a means to inhibit Notch signaling,"The Notch signaling pathway is active in directing cell behaviour during embryonic development and in adults. Notch functions in normal processes, such as blood vessel formation; while aberrant levels of signaling cause and/or contribute to pathological situations such as degenerative disease and cancer. This project focuses on a ligand of Notch, which uniquely acts as an inhibitor of signaling. We will determine how, at the mechanistic level, this ligand inhibits Notch. This will provide a rationale for how to manipulate Notch signaling in vivo. This will enable therapies to be developed so that Notch signaling can be manipulated in pathological settings.",The University of New South Wales,A/Prof SL Dunwoodie; Dr G Chapman; Dr DB Sparrow,NSW

We aim to make progress in the field to produce concrete results, which will provide further insight into the general structure of moduli spaces.  We will develop new techniques to study the moduli space of Riemann surfaces arising from a new and interesting way of counting lattice points in the moduli space and from cone moduli spaces.  We will also develop a rigorous framework for studying the moduli space of monopoles arising in geometric Langlands.",The University of Melbourne,Dr PT Norbury; Mr NN Do,Vic
DP1094329,2009,2010,Statistical Mechanics of Classical Glasses,"Understanding the transition from a supercooled liquid to a glass is an important unsolved problem in science. Although an aged glass has time independent properties, it is not in true thermodynamic equilibrium. It is a time independent, nondissipative, nonergodic, nonequilibrium state. Over the last two years we have developed the first rigorous mathematical description of the molecular distribution in glasses. Using this theory and computer simulation, we plan to study: the dynamic range of linear response to external perturbations in glasses and Kauzmann's Paradox. Using rheology this research will also answer a very simple but fundamental question: Is a glass an arrested fluid? Or is it a disordered solid?",The Australian National University,Prof DJ Evans,ACT

This approach enables in-silico experimentation, providing the ability to ask questions about how a system operates, why it works, and whether it is possible to alter the basic processes using external factors.



In this ambitious proposal we aim to perform research that both expands the state of the art in biological multi-scaled modelling and simulation, with a particular focus on the heart, and the software systems required to make this work.

DP1094337,2009,2010,Energy Dissipation and Nanoscale Processes at Moving Contact Lines,"Understanding how liquids spread and wet flat surfaces, capillaries, open channels and particles requires the determination of energy dissipation at the moving liquid front, or contact line, and the nanoscale processes that take place. Without this knowledge many natural processes will remain a mystery and technologies undeveloped. We will use novel techniques to design interfaces, control solid-liquid interactions and interrogate the nanoscale processes at moving contact lines.

DP1094338,2009,2010,Insurgency and Strategic Non-Violence: The Resistance in East Timor ,"This project investigates strategic non-violence during a successful insurgency against foreign occupation. It examines the East Timorese resistance, especially its use of strategic non-violence under conditions of international isolation. The project is significant because the resistance was confined to a half-island territory with no land border to a friendly state and no external source of military support. With only a handful of guerrillas in the mountains, it was an unusual form of insurgency - one in which the military component was virtually absent. The expected outcome is an original contribution to the literature on strategic non-violence and insurgency. ",The University of New South Wales,Dr C Fernandes,NSW

Alkaline permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) are a promising remediation technique for treating acidic groundwater. However, their efficiency and longevity depend on the rate of physical and chemical clogging. The key challenge will be the in-depth study of clogging mechanisms and the development of comprehensive models to include complex hydrogeology and geochemical reaction kinetics, supported by laboratory testing and field monitoring.

DP1094559,2009,2010,Roaming around the Transition State:  A New Mechanism of Chemical Reactions,"The concept of a reaction mechanism is one of the cornerstones of chemistry. One potentially important discovery in recent years is a new gas-phase mechanism, called 'roaming', which provides a path to new reaction products. There is as yet no predictive theory that allows us to recognise when roaming will be important in other reactions. The aims of this project are to: i) determine the parameters that describe roaming; ii) determine whether roaming may be responsible for isomerisation and isotope exchange; iii) determine the roaming reaction rate; and iv) develop an effective, broadly applicable model for roaming that can be used as a predictive tool for modelling of complex gas-phase chemistry.",The University of Sydney,Prof SH Kable; Prof J Bowman; Dr DL Osborn,NSW

This precludes silicon being used in devices where direct electron transfer to the silicon is required. We present the first viable strategy for stabilising all forms of silicon such that it can be used in electrochemical and molecular electronic devices without oxidising.

Globalisation seems to imply that all parts of the world are becoming increasingly alike. The veracity of this assumption is investigated by studying changes in the entropy of the global income distribution. Entropy is an information-theoretic concept that measures the 'sameness' of a distribution across space and time; it captures both the overall dispersion of a distribution and the existence of specific distributional patterns. A particular focus of this study is the evolution of globalisation in times of crisis, when established patterns may more easily be breached.",The University of Sydney,Dr SJ Babones,NSW

Coexistence of tree species has been linked to a trade-off between juvenile shade tolerance and maximum growth rate. We will test whether geographic variation in this trade-off determines (a) zonation of woody vegetation, and (b) the range of viable carbon-balance strategies (and hence number of species) present in tree assemblages.

This type of matter has emergent physics mimicking elementary particles and fields and is remarkably accessible in table top experiments.  A striking outcome in two dimensional lattices are particles dubbed anyons which have richer statistics than bosons and fermions in nature, and can perform intrinsically error free quantum computation. This theory project will find ways to design such states by quantum engineering, develop theory for prototype realizations using cold trapped atoms or molecules, and develop applications e.g. quantum walks with anyons to study statistical mechanics of braided systems.",Macquarie University,A/Prof G Brennen,NSW

In many cases ore minerals are deposited by replacement of rocks deep within the Earth, a process where the existing minerals reacts with the fluid to form the ore.  At a fundamental level, the formation of an ore deposit is governed by the physical chemistry of dissolution and crystallization, and by fluid flow through porous rocks and fractures. This project is devoted to understanding these chemical and physical processes and how this knowledge can be applied to improve mineral exploration, mining, and processing.

His 1958 book, The Americans, revolutionised post-War photography, offering a radically new approach to the nexus of photographic representation and national identity. Its depiction of alienation, deceptively casual compositional style and juxtaposition of images influenced generations of photographers, filmmakers and visual artists-both within the US and abroad. Since then, Frank has produced a body of work that spans film, photography and writing. This study uses Frank's seminal cross-media experiments to rewrite the history of post-War film and photography-not as the history of distinct and mutually exclusive forms but as a process of creative exchange.",The University of New South Wales,A/Prof G Kouvaros,NSW

Short-lived radionuclides offer precise clocks for these processes. However, the short-lived isotopic chronometers measure only relative time differences, and require a reliable time anchor to map the relative ages onto an absolute timescale. This project seeks to provide precise and accurate U-Pb absolute age anchors for Hf-W and Nb-Zr short-lived isotopic chronometers by integrating U-Pb, Hf-W, and Nb-Zr isotopic data from meteoritic zircon.

Chemical control measures are ineffective against this pathogen, so disease management is largely achieved by the use of resistant varieties. However, the durability of this approach is limited by the pathogen's ability to overcome varietal resistance. This project aims to increase our limited understanding of the molecular processes underlying plant resistance through the functional characterisation of a newly discovered class of resistance protein effective against Fusarium wilt.

DP1095280,2009,2010,Tracking mass transport during metamorphism using in situ micro-analysis of minerals,"Fluids and magmas produced during metamorphism of crustal rocks affect large-scale mass transport in the Earth and, hence, play a crucial role in crustal differentiation, the heat budget of Earth, the carbon and water cycles and the formation of orebodies. Nonetheless, we lack the most basic information on element mobility during metamorphism. Applying the latest innovations in geochemistry to metamorphic rock packages will allow us unique insights into the behaviour and mobilization of elements during metamorphism. The information gained will improve our understanding of how and where elements are distributed and concentrated in the Earth's principal chemical reservoirs.

Four multi-lingual historians will analyse archival material from England, Italy, France and Germany: some newly-discovered, some known but neglected for its relevance to rehearsal practice. 

This contrastive analysis of historical rehearsal practice will constitute a significant rethinking of how and why European performance developed as it did prior to the arrival of the figure of the independent director. 

What did rehearsal consist of, how did it develop in relation to performance, and how did collaborative processes evolve to create a space for the director?",The University of Sydney,A/Prof T Fitzpatrick; Dr L Ginters; Dr JD Golder; Prof TP Stern,NSW

It is known, by remarkable work of Perelman, that all three-dimensional spaces can be decomposed into pieces admitting uniform geometric structures. However a constructive way of finding these structures is not known. We will attack this problem by finding suitable ways of splitting each space into tetrahedra which carry the geometry. This will enable us to construct and implement new practical algorithms to recognise different three-dimensional spaces and to identify important surfaces in them, as needed in knot theory.",The University of Melbourne,Prof JH Rubinstein; A/Prof CD Hodgson; Dr S Tillmann,Vic

The role of stone tool manufacture in hominin evolution is a crucial element of archaeological research and the premise that certain early tools were intentionally designed underpins the Standard Sequence of technological progression.  A contrary position is that although these tools are superficially complex, they were not intentionally designed-they are spandrels.

A comparative study of seven countries,"Researchers have shown that school socio-economic composition is strongly associated with student outcomes. This study will contribute to our emerging knowledge of the relationship by examining how it varies for different students, schools, and countries. The study will also investigate the school-level factors that may mediate the relationship, such as school resources and climate. Finally, the study will show how low socio-economic schools differ from middle and high socio-economic schools. In addition to building our knowledge of the relationship across a variety of contexts, the findings of the study will highlight ways to invest in and support low socio-economic schools in Australia and other countries.

DP1097059,2009,2010,Automatic Brain Tissue Segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Images based on Knowledge-guided Constrained Clustering,"This research studies the problem of automatic MR brain image segmentation using Knowledge-guided constrained clustering. Accurate volumetric measurement of brain tissues is needed to detect the subtle tissue atrophy in many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease. This research investigates two key issues: (i) the use of high level domain knowledge to constrain the clustering process, and (ii) the formulation of the partial volume averaging problem as an image restoration problem. The success of this research will make significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field of medical image analysis and clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders.

DP1097075,2009,2010,The Objects of Probabilities,"Probability statements take the form: P(X) = r. For example, the probability that a fair coin lands heads is 1/2: P(heads) = 1/2. Almost all the literature in the philosophy of probability has concerned the nature of P. Meanwhile, the nature of X, the kinds of things to which probabilities are assigned, has been neglected. This project will redress this imbalance. It will answer the question: What are the objects of probabilities? The answer will depend on the type of probability involved, and it will require us to reconsider how probability theory is formulated. This takes us to the foundations of probability and decision theory, and thus of all philosophy, science, and public policy that are based on these theories.

DP1097081,2009,2010,Optical manipulation of single molecules in nanocontainers and nanotubes,This project will develop techniques for confining and studying the behavior of single molecules in nanocontainers and nanotubes. The nanocontainers are microscopic water droplets in an immiscible medium that can be trapped by focused laser beams (optical tweezers). This technology enables the rapid mixing of the contents of water droplets at the sub-femtoliter volume level for studying transient complexes and non-equilibrium biomolecular phenomena. The nanotubes are created by pulling on the membrane of a polymer vesicle (polymersome) using optical tweezers. The polymer nanotube-vesicle structure is stabilized by chemical and/or UV-induced cross-linking. We propose to study the transport of long molecules down such nanoscale conduits.,Monash University,Dr KP Helmerson,Vic

We aim to study operator algebras associated to very general mathematical objects called groupoids. Groupoids are informative models for many important operator algebras, and the significance of our program lies in the breadth of this class. Our research will lead to two main outcomes. First, we will develop a theory which classifies a large class of operator algebras, called Fell algebras, using groupoids. Second, guided by graph-algebra techniques, we will analyse a broad class of groupoid algebras associated with dynamical systems. Since groupoids are so general and arise in many areas of mathematics, our results will be of wide

It will show that, contrary to prevailing views, the novel urban practices of coffee drinking, smoking, singing, and entertaining in public that transformed the social organisation of the city, introducing new convivial sociability based on public exchange, emerged first in the Islamic culture and were embedded in the lifestyle of Middle-Eastern cities. It will uncover two centuries of virtually unknown debate on the socio-religious merit of urban secularism and document the results in two books.",The University of Adelaide,A/Prof S Akkach,SA

But does this accountability reform necessarily enhance political citizenship and the ability of the ruled to hold rulers to account? Or is it also being deployed to insulate elites from scrutiny and as an alternative to democratic representation and contestation?  We ask why powerful political and economic interests support accountability and what this tells us about changing relationships between states and citizens in Southeast Asia.

Therapeutic treatments are consequently limited and there is no cure to this worldwide socially and economically costly disease. Recent evidence indicates that membrane-associated Abeta peptide is responsible for the characteristic nerve cell damage in AD, and not the much-studied amyloid fibrils. Structural investigations at the molecular level are thus difficult, like so many other membrane protein targets in biomedical research. We aim to adapt and demonstrate solid state NMR techniques necessary to elucidate the structure of Abeta peptide with membranes and metal to help understand the toxic mechanisms of the diseases like AD.",The University of Melbourne,Dr JD Gehman; Prof F Separovic; Prof JD Wade,Vic

This process is controlled by two genes, a plant resistance (R) gene and a pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene. In the case of flax rust, we demonstrated a direct interaction between the products of the R and Avr genes, determined the crystal structure of the flax rust Avr protein, and produced pure recombinant R protein in Pichia pastoris. The proposed project will build on these results and characterize the interaction between R and Avr proteins through biochemical interaction analysis, mutagenesis and structural biology.

When the invader brings its own parasites with it, they can switch hosts and attack the native fauna. Selective pressures imposed by the invasion can change the interaction between the invader and its own parasites.  My recent work shows that cane toads have brought lungworm parasites with them which now attack native frogs, and interestingly some cane toad populations that had until recently escaped the parasite.

This project will research the problem in new ways, and explore possible solutions.",RMIT University,Prof MC Burry; Prof JH Frazer; Ms JR Burry,Vic
DP0985074,2008,2009,Is Compulsory Voting Defensible?,"One of the most urgent political problems in the industrialised world is declining voter turnout, a trend that is steepest among the young and the poor. Compulsory voting (CV) seems to be the most decisive  remedy for this problem. Yet, for many, it is an unacceptable violation of liberal and democratic values. This empirically-informed, political theory project evaluates whether or not CV does, in fact, violate such values. By uniquely integrating the two sets of relevant knowledge (empirical studies and political theory) I will examine how well, in theory and in practice, CV either serves or violates liberal-democratic values. I will also develop best-practice guidelines for current users and prospective adopters of compulsory voting. ",The University of Adelaide,A/Prof LE Hill,SA
DP0985077,2008,2009,The innovation pool in Australian biotechnology: assessing strategies for fostering innovation through patenting and patent pooling ,"The Australian biotechnology industry is characterised by many small players that use patents to manage commercialisation of their research. A side effect in such industries that build on complementary innovation is fragmentation of rights. This can increase transaction and coordination costs and slow or stifle innovation. Patent pooling is a potential tool to free up inherent problems in traditional patent management, but there is a risk of anti-competitive conduct. We propose to: assess how the current Australian biotechnology industry is working; examine whether patent pooling is a feasible/desirable option; and make recommendations regarding the need for regulatory changes to increase benefits and reduce costs of patent management.",University of Tasmania,A/Prof D Nicol; Dr J Nielsen; Dr CR Critchley; Prof R Aoki,Tas

However our understanding of the specific interactions between the salt ions and the interfaces is still limited by empiricism. This project aims to expand our understanding of the molecular phenomena and properties of saline water-air interfaces that underpin industrially important processes such as micron bubble coalescence and dissolved air flotation in water desalination.

With increasing global temperatures, sea levels are changing and surface and groundwater resources are becoming increasingly precious. This project will exploit space gravity data to assess, quantify and understand when and where Australia's water resources change. This will be achieved through the development of a new analysis method, validation against independently-observed oceanic signals and the subsequent study of geophysical phenomena including the global redistribution of ocean water caused by the warming of the oceans and the propagation of water deficit and groundwater depletion caused by drought in the Murray Darling basin.",The Australian National University,Dr P Tregoning; Dr M Leblanc; Dr G RAMILLIEN,ACT

The Bannermen (the Manchu-Mongol-Han elite, organised under Eight Military Banners) ruled China's last dynasty (1644-1911), inheriting the responsibility for the heritage and environment (agrarian life, water conservancy) of the empire. We study key texts and works of art of the period and demonstrate how the Bannermen made a unique contribution to Chinese culture.

Solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation on a square-integrable basis is combined with the convergent close-coupling (CCC) method describing many-electron correlations in the final ionized state. This combined method will be applied to the processes of attosecond pulse production, their interaction with matter and steering of coherent wave packets. This will advance our knowledge of attosecond atomic physics and guide a new generation of experiments involving free-electron and conventional lasers, as well as charged particle accelerators.",The Australian National University,Prof AS Kheifets; Prof I Bray; Prof Dr JH Ullrich,ACT

However, sounding out is slow and error prone, so children need to move to recognising words by sight in order to become proficient readers. Surprisingly little is known about how this transition is achieved. We will conduct a series of experiments with primary-school children exploring how they learn to read by sight, focussing particularly on the influences of vocabulary, word regularity and context. Learning impairments in subgroups of poor readers will also be explored. The findings will directly inform theory and practice in reading development and enhance the treatment of reading difficulties.",Macquarie University,Prof AE Castles; Prof K Nation,NSW

It has long been known that superfluid helium can flow without resistance below a critical speed, yet the best theories still vastly overestimate its value in doughnut shaped containers. In a joint experimental and theoretical program we will elucidate the mechanism that limits the superfluid velocity in ring-shaped systems.  BECs also promise to be ultra-sensitive measuring devices.

We discovered in rats that BAT metabolism waxes and wanes every 100 minutes, correlating with changes in EEG arousal, blood pressure and heart rate, and with activity. These 'ultradian' metabolic rhythms in rats are quite similar to the 90-100 min Basic Rest Activity Cycles in humans.

No other factor has been reported to accomplish this. Given stem cells underpin the daily replenishing of cells throughout the body, understanding how this occurs is of broad significance. By employing mice whose GH-signalling pathway has been genetically modified and altering GH receptor signalling in normal mice (using molecular techniques), we aim to determine which component of the pathway is responsible for transforming a normally quiescent NSC into a constitutively proliferating cell type.",The University of Queensland,Dr RL Rietze; Prof Dr MJ Waters,Qld

Unfortunately almost all writings of the early Greek philosophers are lost, making us dependent on second-hand reports. An important source of information is the genre of doxography, brief systematically organized accounts of important doctrines attributed to individual philosophers. The project will uncover and produce the text of the most important ancient doxographer, Aetius, based on principles developed in our previous research. The resultant edition will supersede the outdated work of Diels (1879) and be of inestimable value to all scholars working in the field of early Greek philosophy.

Aggressive individuals are also a risk to themselves. Over 30 years of research now demonstrates that these individuals are at increased risk for coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, and mortality from cardiovascular causes.

Asexual females arise from an unusual meiosis in which two maternal nuclei fuse as if one acted as a sperm.  The phenomenon is significant as it provides a model system to explore the costs and benefits of asexual and sexual reproduction. The project will explain how queen eggs can eliminate male genomes and thus allow a queen to clone herself, and how the queen can have control of the meiosis that occurs in her eggs even after they are laid.",The University of Sydney,Prof BP Oldroyd,NSW

DP0985502,2008,2009,Non-invasive diagnosis using micropatches that sample biomarkers from skin,"A major stumbling block in the early diagnosis of diseases (e.g. cancer) that originate in solid tissues is the absence of diagnostic biomarkers in blood. So to detect such diseases, a blood sample is not enough and tissue biopsies (e.g. colonoscopy) are required. However, biopsy is often highly invasive, thus unsuitable for routine screening vital for early diagnosis. In this project, we will develop a non-invasive micro-projection array (micropatch) tissue sampling technology that extracts interstitial fluid from skin; and evaluate it for diagnosis in the mouse model.

DP0985600,2008,2009,Synthesising prior information for ecological research and management,"Bayesian statistical methods have two main advantages; they are suitable for analysing complex models, and can incorporate existing (prior) information. Although Bayesian methods are being used increasingly in ecology, ecologists rarely include prior information in their models. We will synthesise previous ecological research to generate Bayesian priors for future studies. We will examine life-history and functional traits of plants and animals, generating priors for population ecology, trait-based studies, and the conservation management of native vegetation. We will evaluate these priors by comparing them with independent data. By facilitating the use of prior information, our project can revolutionise the way that ecology is conducted.",The University of Melbourne,Dr MA McCarthy; Dr PA Vesk,Vic

The proposed computational and measurement program will fill key knowledge gaps underlying the breaking of real ocean waves. 



When incorporated into our new framework for predicting onset and strength of wave breaking of idealised unidirectional waves, the results will extend its applicability to real ocean waves.



This pioneering study will add wave breaking forecasts to the next generation of numerical models for global predictions of sea state, weather and climate change, with consequent greater modelling accuracy.

DP0985604,2008,2009,Our Island Home: The shifting map of Australian literature,This project will show how Australia's unique status as an island continent has shaped Australian literature.  Key questions posed are: How was the colonial cartography of the Australian mainland and islands represented in literature?  Why did Australia increasingly identify as an island rather than a continent from the 1940s? How did this shift in emphasis re-form Australian literature?  How do these fluctuations position Australian literature at this second great era of globalisation? As the first major study of Australia's literary islands the project will provide new paradigms for reading Australian literature and for recognising its potential in the global context.,The University of New South Wales,Dr EN McMahon,NSW

Here we explore a range of framework phases that display two fundamentally interesting and highly useful properties: 1) nanoporosity, ie. the ability to reversibly exchange guest molecules; and 2) negative thermal expansion, ie. contraction upon warming.  The approach addresses key questions in the science of nanoscale systems and will lead to fundamental breakthroughs in understanding.  Commercialisation of the materials will see the creation of innovative high-level technologies in both host-guest (eg. separations, sensing, energy conversion) and thermal expansion (eg. photonics, electronics) applications.",The University of Sydney,Prof CJ Kepert,NSW

Air pressure in a weather system may be balanced by wind velocity, or migration in a population of herbivores may be balanced by birth and death rates. When the essential quantities are measured over discrete intervals, or the system is simulated on a computer, the models become difference equations. Surprisingly, even for difference equations that are suspected to be free of chaos, the longstanding initial-value problem in several dimensions remains unsolved. We aim to solve this problem for integrable difference equations in two dimensions.",The University of Sydney,Prof N Joshi,NSW

We will test the hypothesis that this is accounted for by a trade-off involving costs and efficiency of P acquisition. Furthermore, we will test hypotheses why species that are less efficient at acquiring P can co-occur with species with cluster roots on the most severely P-depleted soils. This will deepen our understanding of the functioning of the P-impoverished ecosystems in the south-western Australia biodiversity hot-spot that supports all functional groups we propose to investigate.",The University of Western Australia,Prof JT Lambers; Dr EJ Veneklaas; Dr KW Dixon,WA

Previous research has shown that obese individuals are more responsive to such cues than people of normal weight. The proposal presents a series of experiments investigating the implicit cognitive processing mechanisms that underlie this heightened responsiveness, which we propose represent an unrecognised factor contributing to the failure of overweight individuals to achieve and maintain weight loss. The ultimate aim of our novel approach is to develop a viable protocol for the modification of food-related cognitions in the obese.

DP0986118,2008,2009,Left of centre: Attentional distortions in the mental representation of space in healthy and clinical populations,"Our brains can only attend to a limited amount of information at a time. This research investigates this constraint with respect to left/right imbalances in attention, which occur in the intact brain and are especially evident after stroke. While it is known that imbalances in attention can cause objects to be ignored, relatively little is known about how these imbalances affect the way we think about those objects. Asymmetries in the mental construction of space will be investigated using left/right sequences, such as numbers. The research will provide new insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms that control attention and will have important practical benefits for the effective diagnosis and treatments of attentional disorders.

DP0986137,2008,2009,Peripheral and central mechanisms of sensory coding and integration,"This research project will study how sensations from different modalities (vision and touch) are combined in our perceptual experience, and identify those brain structures that underlie these inter-sensory interactions. We will take advantage of the unique opportunity provided by the somatosensory system to make direct recordings of peripheral tactile sensory nerves while simultaneously obtaining perceptual judgments from awake human participants. This will elucidate how physical stimuli are transformed into perceptual experiences by our nervous system, and will break new ground in answering fundamental questions about the constraints that peripheral encoding places on central processing and perception.",The University of Sydney,A/Prof JA Harris; A/Prof CW Clifford; Dr E Arabzadeh,NSW
DP0986139,2008,2009,Investigating a new paradigm for plant-pathogen interactions; Identification of host-selective toxin proteins in the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum,"We have verified that the pathogenicity of Stagonospora nodorum, a major fungal pathogen of wheat, depends predominantly on the secretion of multiple (at least eight) host-selective toxin proteins that each interact with different plant susceptibility proteins causing necrosis and disease. This toxin-receptor system, a mirror image of the familiar gene-for-gene system that involves pathogen avirulence and plant resistance genes, defines a new paradigm in plant-pathogen interactions. Our goal is to identify each of the toxins and assess their role in disease at the individual and population levels. The identification of these toxins will provide a valuable insight into the evolution, origins and spread of pathogenicity. ",Murdoch University,Dr PS Solomon; Prof RP Oliver; Dr RJ Lipscombe,WA

DP0986142,2008,2009,Re-evaluating the role of tannins in Australian forest ecosystems,"Ecologists have a rather poor understanding of how tannins affect ecosystems, partly due to a preoccupation with chemistry and methods of analysis.  We have published an innovative technique that circumvents these problems.  It permits the user to measure the effects of tannins in any ecosystem in a common currency. We plan to use this method to provide basic knowledge about the interactions between tannins and nitrogen in eucalypts and measure its genetic basis - information not available previously.  This enables us to better understand key ecological processes, such as animal feeding and litter degradation, and to predict the effects of climate change.  The outcome is a novel way of looking at the chemistry of eucalypt forests.",The Australian National University,Dr IR Wallis; Prof WJ Foley,ACT

Preventing genocide and mass atrocities saves lives and is much cheaper than intervening to halt killings once underway and rebuilding societies afterwards. However, preventive policies require accurate early warning systems and at present the world lacks a framework capable of delivering accurate and timely early warning of genocide and mass atrocities.  This project aims to develop, test and refine just a system that could then incorporated into any comprehensive policy framework for preventing mass killing.

A key design issue is the trade-off between robustness against false alarms and quick detection. In this project we will develop new statistical methods for change detection which explore the close links between system identification and change detection. Algorithms will be designed with an arbitrary user-chosen probability of a false alarm for any given number of observed data points.

Empirical evidence strongly implicates natural selection in speciation, yet the genetic and ecological mechanisms operating during this process remain unknown.  We will use a novel approach to provide the first experimental reconstruction of the early stages of speciation, investigate how genes and ecology drive the process of divergence using experimental evolution in the wild, and use genomic tools to determine if parallel adaptation to different environments involves the same genes. Our study puts forward a comprehensive and novel approach to understand how genes and ecology drive speciation.",The University of Queensland,Dr D Ortiz-Barrientos; A/Prof PB Mather; Prof Dr LH Rieseberg,Qld
DP0986175,2008,2009,Speciation and the breakdown of coevolution during hybridisation,"Just as hosts and parasites evolve in step with each other, genes within the cell are also known to coevolve. Because populations can become geographically isolated and mutation is random, the coevolution of genes may take different evolutionary paths. Populations whose genes coevolve independently may become incompatible and incapable of interbreeding. We will test how novel nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic combinations in hybrids affect heredity, gene expression, and how coevolved genes affect hybrid fitness.

Chemokine binding proteins have been studied in other large DNA viruses (ie poxviruses) and are a key mechanism of immune evasion. The herpesviruses proteins, however, do not appear to resemble any chemokine binding proteins that have been studied previously. This project will examine the structure and function of these proteins in a panel of evolutionarily diverse herpesviruses that infect avian, eutherian and Australian marsupial hosts.

It is the fundamental mechanism by which the terrestrial planets have evolved both chemically and physically through time and central to how the crust has evolved from mantle, how metallic cores are formed from undifferentiated planetary bodies and how economic elements can be concentrated. This proposal tackles this primary process by using the true (observed) rock textures and compositions as templates uniquely constrained by experiment so numerical modelling can quantify flow processes and deformation regimes.

DP0986766,2008,2009,A multi-scale approach for modelling coupled transport in heterogeneous and anisotropic porous media,An innovative multi-scale mathematical theory is developed for simulating transport in porous media where macro-/micro-spatial interactions occur on independent time scales. These spatial interactions are treated using a multi-resolution finite volume method that couples classical continuum macro-scale equations with a variable order fractional-in-space diffusion equation for modelling flow through the microstructure. Image analysis techniques are used to estimate the varying fractal dimensions of the microstructure and experimental data is used to calibrate the model. Two examples of high environmental importance where this theory finds application are seawater intrusion in coastal alluvial aquifer systems and drying timber.,Queensland University of Technology,Prof IW Turner; Prof VV Anh; Prof PG Perré,Qld

DP0987043,2008,2009,Development of methodology for high throughput free energy calculations in drug design applications.,"The accurate estimation of binding affinity of a ligand to the protein remains a major challenge in drug discovery. We will develop medium to high throughput single-point free energy calculation methods for drug design applications. The method will be validated against GP (Glycogen phosphorylase, an anti-diabetic target) and PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, a CNS target) datatsets. The outcomes of this project will be:  (a) understanding of the GP-inhibitor binding thermodynamics and insights into anti-diabetic drug design; (b) identification of fragment hits for subsequent lead optimization for PNMT; and (c) a virtual screening protocol for fragment-based drug design.",The University of Queensland,Mr AK Malde,Qld
DP0987045,2008,2009,Noncanonical epitope recognition by CD8+ T lymphocytes,"Nearly all cells in jawed vertebrates express surface MHC-I molecules. Upon infection with viruses, these molecules present peptides derived from viral gene products for recognition by CD8+ T cells which then lyse the infected cells. For many years, scientists have been mapping these antigenic peptides (epitopes), primarily for use in vaccines. This proposal aims to improve our understanding of this fundamental physiological process and enhance epitope mapping techniques by investigating the relative importance of noncanonical epitopes (peptides of >10 amino acids, or derived from alternative reading frame products) in CD8+ T cell recognition. The project has the potential to trigger a paradigm shift in the field of antigen presentation.",Griffith University,A/Prof SR Burrows,Qld
DP0987051,2008,2009,Understanding adolescent leadership for civic engagement in secondary schools and community groups,This project investigates adolescents' understanding of leadership for civic engagement in schools and community groups. Its significance lies in its focus on the 'research voice' of young people about leadership and its connection with prosocial adolescent engagement. New understanding is imperative at a time when anti-social activity and youth disengagement are receiving extensive media coverage. Our study will document what young people 'see' as leadership and the situations and circumstances in which they say that leadership for responsible civic engagement is evident. Our findings will provide the empirical basis for a youth-centred reconceptualising of adolescent leadership.,Griffith University,Prof N Dempster; A/Prof AJ Lizzio; Dr JL Skinner; A/Prof DC Andrews; Dr MB Keeffe,Qld

An admix of SiC and SiO will be designed to strongly emit heat only across the limited band where the atmosphere is highly transparent to thermal radiation. Other radiation will be reflected or transmitted to reduce heat gain from the atmosphere once surfaces drop below ambient. Since transparency of the sky to heat drops at lower angles, additional performance will be sought when low angle incoming radiation is blocked using solar concentrator like configurations. A goal with these is low energy hybrid cooling to ice temperatures.","University of Technology, Sydney",Prof GB Smith,NSW

Whilst the evolution of signals is well studied, the evolution of receiver characteristics are poorly understood, especially in the context of chemical communication, which is surprising given the ubiquity of chemical signals. Insect antennae are perhaps the most distinctive of chemical receptor structures and they have evolved into an astonishing diversity of forms; from simple filaments to the exquisite feathery structures of some moths. We shall investigate, via experimentation on model moth species and comparative analysis across whole groups of insects, the role of sexual and natural selection in shaping the diversity of chemical receptor structures.",The University of Melbourne,Prof MA Elgar,Vic

DP0987580,2008,2009,New paradigms for high-resolution microwave photonic signal processing.,"This project aims to generate fundamental research outcomes to realise dynamically reconfigurable, high-resolution photonic signal processors. Signal processing using optical delay lines is a powerful technique for processing high bandwidth signals, overcoming limited sampling speeds in conventional electrical signal processors. However, simultaneous realisation of high-resolution, low-noise and wide tunability is difficult, and has not previously been solved. This project proposes new paradigms for photonic processor topologies to solve, for the first time, the long-standing problem of achieving widely tunable, high-resolution processors. The expected outcomes are new processors that herald wideband adaptive processing within the fibre.",The University of Sydney,Prof RA Minasian,NSW

A targeted approach will clarify the role played by a specific component of the immune system, IL-1b (Aim1) and elucidate the underlying endocrine (Aim 2) and immune mechanisms (Aim 3). Once specific mechanisms that underlie programming phenomena in animals have been identified, the developmental biology of these mechanisms can be compared with that of humans. This knowledge is necessary to determine putative effects of programming on human health.

This approach exploits the high Q of these resonators, the long quantum coherence times of the rare-earth ions and the fact that the ions can be held stationary in the region of the whispering gallery mode where the atom-light interaction is greatest. This project will provide a significant enabling technology for quantum information processing.",The Australian National University,Dr MJ Sellars,ACT
DP0988088,2008,2009,A Gesture-Based Interface for Designing in Virtual Reality ,"The main objective of this project is to integrate existing technologies in motion tracking, 3D modeling and VR, in order to design a novel interface to support the design process. Using this interface, a designer can define the contour of a sketch by controlling a pointer using cyber gloves and interact with the design product by wearing a sensor-based jacket and a head-mounted-display. Thus, the VR system provides a ""3D sketch pad"". This project may promote the development of innovative virtual prototyping technologies. The major outcome will be the detailed exploration of sketching behaviour in 3D and cognitive processes in design. The novelty of this approach is the use of protocol analysis in VR system development.",Macquarie University,Dr M Kavakli,NSW
DP0988099,2008,2009,Biosynthesis of multiple-nonmetal codoped titania nanoparticles for visible light photocatalysis,"Titania (TiO2) is a desirable photocatalyst, because of its relatively high reactivity and chemical stability, however it is photoactive only on exposure to ultraviolet light, hindering its practical applications. This project will use peptide-mediated synthesis to generate highly efficient 'multiple-anion doped' titania photocatalyst. This will significantly lower the reaction energy barriers, and provide better visible-light photoactivity. This will lead to a highly efficient nanomaterial with numerous indoor- and visible-light photocatalysis applications, which can be commercially introduced to the market, since the synthesis is low-cost and eco-friendly.",RMIT University,Dr V Bansal,Vic

Disorders of communication occur in many clinical conditions including autism, traumatic brain injury, stroke and Alzheimers Disease. We know little about the causes of these problems nor how to manage them.  This project will advance understanding of the neuropsychology of communication by determining whether problems understanding the emotional states of others and using social knowledge underpin communication failure in adults with frontal lobe lesions as well as the role of non-social factors.  The outcome will inform understanding of the many conditions that involve frontal lobe damage and how to assess and manage them. ",The University of New South Wales,Prof S McDonald,NSW

This macromolecular structure provides the microbial cell with structural integrity, shape, adherence, locomotion and is the interface between the microbe and the environment. Recent experimental data describing a novel secretion domain termed the ExPortal, as well as a number of anchorless cell wall proteins, point to a hitherto uncharacterised transport and secretion system in the Gram-positive cocci. The goal of this project is to use molecular microbiology and state of the art mass spectrometry techniques to analyse the cell wall components and their structural organization in a model Gram-positive cocci.",University of Wollongong,Prof MJ Walker; Dr JA Aquilina,NSW

In sexual organisms, negative frequency-dependent selection plays a role in maintaining diversity at some loci, but in asexual organisms this mechanism could provide a general explanation for persistent genetic diversity because it acts on the whole genome and not just some polymorphisms within a genome. I intend to empirically test the generality of negative frequency-dependent selection as a mechanism for maintaining genetic variation in asexual organisms and provide insight into why the majority of species reproduce sexually.",The University of Melbourne,Dr AR Weeks,Vic

DP0988751,2008,2009,Galactic Archaeology: a Challenge for the Cold Dark Matter Paradigm,"The vast stellar content of our Galaxy contains the fossil imprints of how it was formed. The current model for galaxy formation-the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm-is that they have built up over billions of years by the merging of smaller systems, but cosmological simulations fail to reproduce the key properties of individual galaxies. The predicted high level of merger activity makes it very difficult to form galaxies like our own. This is the key stumbling block to progress at the present time. Our goal is to assess observationally how important mergers have actually been in the formation of the Galaxy, the critical test of CDM. We will target the stars in the Galactic disk and bulge with a new generation of wide-field spectrographs.",The University of Sydney,Prof J Bland-Hawthorn; Prof KC Freeman; Dr SC Keller; Prof M Asplund,NSW

We aim to analyse the notion of being fundamental, to integrate the notion of fundamentality into a re-conception of metaphysics as studying fundamentality structure, and to consult physics in studying what is fundamental. In so doing, we aim to revive the classical monistic view that the universe is fundamental. This view links the philosophical tradition of Plotinus, Spinoza, and Hegel to the physical picture of the cosmos as a single entangled quantum system.

Addressing this question, the study examines Islamic populism in post-authoritarian Indonesia, drawing comparisons with North Africa and the Middle East. Rather than explaining Islamic populism in terms of cultural or security concerns, social structural changes related to the rise of new social classes and the decline of others are at the fore of this analysis. These processes give rise to struggles within the state and over the exercise of state power. This study marks a conceptual innovation in analysing relationships between state, class and Islamic populism in this way.",Murdoch University,Dr VR Hadiz,WA

FT0992164,2008,2009,Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of terminal lymphocyte differentiation and alterations of the same that lead to leukemia.,"Terminal differentiation of lymphocytes leads to the acquisition of effector functions including the ability to kill pathogens or pathogen-infected cells; it also leads eventually to exit from cell growth. In parallel to effector differentiation the immune systems sets aside memory cells, which can protect the body from reinfection. Distortions or blockade of differentiation can lead to loss of protection or the development of leukemia. Transcription factors control these processes; however, their precise function is not well-understood. The proposed work aims to clarify the roles of some of these factors in normal lymphocyte differentiation as well as in leukemia.

LP0989340,2008,2009,Application of direct protein transduction of Stem Cell Factors to reprogram mouse and human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells,"Derivation of pluripotent stem cells can be induced by retroviral delivery of a defined group of factors into mouse and human somatic cells.  We propose to reproduce these results in both species using a safer and possibly more efficient protein transduction approach.  Unlike the retroviral delivery, our approach will not result in genome modification and will enable the factors to be present only in the required timeframe.  This method may provide an unlimited supply of patient-specific cells for regenerative medicine with closer histocompatibility matches with recipients, eliminating the need to use embryos for generating new embryonic stem cell lines.

LP0989354,2008,2009,Enhancing Seagrass Restoration : Improving Hessian Durability in Marine Environments,"The Adelaide coastline has lost over 5,200 hectares of seagrass habitat. Poor water quality has led to seabed deepening and instability. Subsequent seagrass recovery has failed because the denuded sand does not support recruitment. DEH and SARDI Aquatic Sciences have developed a promising method to enhance natural seagrass recruitment, using Hessian sandbags to snag seedlings until capable root systems develop. However, overly-rapid breakdown of the Hessian sandbags has led to limited success thus far. This multidisciplinary project will establish and optimise methods to decrease the rate of bacterial breakdown of the Hessian bags, thus improving their longevity in marine environments, and thereby increasing seagrass seedling survival.",The Flinders University of South Australia,Dr JS Quinton; Dr SR Clarke; Dr K Benkendorff; Dr S Murray-Jones; Mr DG Fotheringham; Dr JE Tanner,SA

LP0989670,2008,2009,Ecosystem restoration of bauxite-processing residue sand disposal areas in Western Australia: Important biogeochemical processes and effective fertilisation strategies,"Australia is one of the world's largest alumina producers. Production of one tonne of alumina generates about two tonnes of highly alkaline, highly saline bauxite-processing residue which is stored in land impoundments (residue disposal areas, RDAs). Revegetation of RDAs is problematic due to the inherently hostile characteristics of residue materials. Rehabilitation of RDAs is a key guiding principle for Alcoa's continued production of alumina and is an integral component of the decision-making process for refinery closure. In this application, we will investigate important biogeochemical cycling processes of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon and develop appropriate fertilisation strategies for successful ecosystem restoration of RDAs.

Not only is this waste economically inefficient, decomposing food releases methane equivalent to over 13 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. However, reducing food waste has proved difficult using behaviour change programs based on economic considerations alone. Rather, food waste is a complex behaviour requiring a more comprehensive understanding of its enduring social and cultural determinants. The project will document and analyse the socio-cultural determinants of food waste to develop a public education and social marketing programme to reduce food waste.",University of South Australia,Prof WA Dawson; A/Prof JW Boland; A/Prof J Coveney; A/Prof PR Ward; Miss M Stasiak; Mr A Gray,SA

LP0990923,2008,2009,Mechanisms and manipulation of seed dormancy maintenance in annual ryegrass and other weed species,"Annual ryegrass is a major weed of Australian cropping systems. Seed dormancy causes the germination of ryegrass populations to occur over an extended period of time, making removal of the plants that emerge after crop germination very difficult. This is especially so because of the widespread evolution of multiple herbicide resistance in ryegrass. Using the knowledge gained from ARC Discovery Project DP0664090 as a foundation, this project aims to charactise biochemical mechanisms of dormancy induction, release and maintenance in annual ryegrass, and apply this information in more efficient removal of ryegrass seeds from the seed bank. Ryegrass can then also be used as a model species to study dormancy in seeds of weedy and native plants.",The University of Western Australia,Prof SB Powles; Dr KW Dixon,WA

Rescuers also require an estimate of where currents will take those adrift. Marine Search and Rescue (SAR) uses infrequent satellite data of currents to estimate drift patterns. Recently developed ocean forecast models will help forecast currents between the satellite observations, but are unproven for SAR use and do not include tidal influences. This project will develop measures of reliability and accuracy of using ocean with tidal forecasts within SAR models and will quantify drift forecast errors from many comparisons with drifter buoys tracks over a two year period. The outcomes will be statistical measures of success in using forecast to improve SAR outcomes.",Griffith University,A/Prof CJ Lemckert; Dr BA King,Qld

Norms guide behaviour where laws do not apply, such as most health behaviour (dieting, exercise, etc.).  Moreover, if norms clash with laws, non-compliance may result (widespread speeding, racial discrimination, etc.).  Research and common sense both agree that unwritten social rules are important.  However, research on norms is conducted with contradictory theories about what norms are.  Our proposal tests an integrative model to resolve this fundamental contradiction.

Progress in reducing this gender gap has been hampered by the lack of a framework explaining how gender simultaneously influences the economic (salary) and social (relationship) outcomes of negotiation.  We integrate two theoretical approaches to explain how the assertive strategies that improve economic outcomes create a perception of negotiation partners as competent and/or likeable, resulting in different social consequences for men and women.  Our goal is to identify the negotiation strategies that enable both men and women to obtain good economic outcomes while maintaining their organisational relationships.",The University of Melbourne,Prof M Olekalns; Prof C Kulik,Vic

DP0877887,2007,2008,To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in antibiotic resistance shown by Gram-negative bacteria.,"The protection beta-lactam antibiotics afford humans against infection is being eroded by the increasing prevalence of bacteria containing AmpC beta-lactamases. AmpC, which destroys these antibiotics, is found in bacteria that cause life-threatening bacterial infections. Production of AmpC depends on the activity of two proteins: AmpR and NagZ. When beta-lactams are present, these enzymes turn on AmpC to destroy the antibiotic. I aim to develop molecules that block the function of these proteins. This approach will make bacteria containing AmpC, normally resisting beta-lactams, susceptible to them. In combination with beta-lactams, these inhibitors could be used to treat dangerous bacterial infections. ",The University of Melbourne,Dr K Stubbs,Vic

Understanding their operation at a molecular level is a fundamental problem in neurology, physiology and pharmacology, and is the first step in finding cures for diseases caused by their malfunction.  The primary tool for studying ion channels is molecular dynamics simulations.  However, due to lack of polarization, the current force fields do not give reliable results.  The project aims to use quantum mechanical and dynamical methods to investigate the effects of polarization in ion channels.

DP0878545,2007,2008,The Liability of Corporate Groups,"The law enables the limitation of legal liability to pay damages for wrongs to the value of the assets of the company conducting business activities. Limited liability was introduced in the days before corporate groups became pervasive.  A pressing issue for company law is to determine the extent to which liability within corporate groups should be limited, especially when claimants have suffered death or personal injury.  This project will survey the various methods by which unfairness to injured claimants might be avoided by imposing liability on persons beyond the wrongdoing company and will make recommendations for reform of the rule of limited liability.",The University of Melbourne,A/Prof CA Witting,Vic

But we need to understand how emissions trading interacts with the wholesale electricity market. Recent experience with emissions trading schemes in Europe has highlighted how complex and poorly understood these interactions are. This project will begin by considering how generation participants respond to emissions trading in operational decision-making (involving forward contracts, permit purchasing and generation bidding). We will then consider the impact on investment decisions. This will enable an evaluation of different emissions trading scheme designs from an economic and emissions perspective.",The University of New South Wales,Prof EJ Anderson; A/Prof HR Outhred; Dr IF MacGill; Dr RA Betz,NSW

As such there are many aspects of plant metabolism that differ to that of other organisms such as animals and fungi. Although photosynthesis is the most obvious plant specific metabolic processes, several other novel biosynthetic pathways exist, e.g. plants de novo make all amino acids and synthesise folate, ascorbate and biotin in contrast to animals. Many of these plant specific metabolic pathways are located in membrane bound organelles, and thus this requires that various metabolites be transported across these membranes. This investigation proposes to define of function of specific novel transport protein in plants.",The University of Western Australia,Dr M Murcha; Prof J Soll,WA

DP0879010,2007,2008,Neural metrics for space time and numerosity ,"Our aim is to find out how people estimate size, time and number, when they do not have access to measuring instruments and do not have the opportunity to count. Because we have preliminary evidence that perceptions of all three can be altered by stimulus properties and conditions of observation, we hypothesize that all may make use of number-tuned neurones in the parietal part of the brain that are arranged to form a scale, in effect an internal measuring instrument. Confirming this hypothesis would cast significant light on how the brain functions and how real and perceived magnitudes are linked.",The University of Western Australia,Em/Prof J Ross; Prof DC Burr,WA
DP0879015,2007,2008,A new legal framework for identifying and reporting Australian data breaches,Data breaches cost organisations millions of dollars each year and can affect millions of people. Yet Australian data breaches are not reported. This research aims to evaluate US data breach reporting frameworks to assess their impact and to examine how a similar reporting mechanism could be developed for Australia. The research is significant because it will generate knowledge that can be used to mitigate potential identity crime threats and enhance corporate reporting. The research outcome will be a framework of recommendations to assist policy makers with the implementation of an Australian data breach reporting mechanism.,Queensland University of Technology,Prof W Lane; Prof PE von Nessen; Dr AJ McCullagh; Mr TJ Smedinghoff,Qld

A key stage in this sequence of events must have involved transforming simple gases that existed billions of years ago following the formation of the planet into the basic molecules that form the building blocks of living matter as we know it today. One hypothesis is that minerals containing iron and sulphur, which are abundant at undersea volcanic erruptions, provided the energy for this process. This research will employ theoretical models to determine whether this represents a plausible beginning for chemistry that underpins life.",Curtin University of Technology,Prof JD Gale; Prof KV Wright; Dr S Piana; Dr A Laio,WA

The physical origins behind these forces are crucial to control particle and droplet stability. Yet, an understanding of these forces in concentrated salt solutions is still an uncharted area despite the prevalence of these systems. Through a novel development of a highly sensitive experimental technique this study will identify the physical origins of these forces. This fundamental study will help connect colloid science to high salt conditions relevant to both industry and biology.",The University of Melbourne,Dr RR Dagastine,Vic

It will focus on changing forms of millenarianism, on the rise of charismatic churches and the decline in cargo cults. Whereas previously rural villagers used cargo cults to resist and reinvent their participation in modernity, today Pentecostal churches provide the pedagogic moral structures in communities where government services have stalled. In many rural areas, schools, medical services, police and courts no longer function and villagers use millenarian forms of Christianity to govern themselves in ways that often contest and undermine the legitimacy of present state institutions.

DP0879253,2007,2008,Environmentally sustainable asymmetric synthesis: design and development of chiral hydrogen bonding organocatalysts,"Many useful organic compounds, especially modern drugs, can exist in two different mirror image forms, or enantiomers. There is a pressing need for new methods to access single enantiomers, due to the often drastically different biological properties of enantiomeric compounds. Asymmetric organocatalysis is an exceptionally efficient and environmentally benign approach to achieving this, whereby small organic molecules catalyse the enantioselective formation of a desired target material. This project aims to design, synthesise and evaluate new organocatalysts based on the principle of hydrogen bonding activation, a common feature of Nature's catalysts, enzymes.",Griffith University,Dr MJ Coster,Qld

DP0879261,2007,2008,Of birds and bees: membrane lipids and the determination of maximum lifespan,"All animals age and die but the basis of this universal process is not understood. Recent Australian research suggests the fat composition of cell membranes is fundamental in determining the maximum possible lifespan for a species. Birds are longer-living than mammals and have a different membrane composition. Queen honeybees are genetically identical to worker bees and have a different membrane composition. While queens live for years, workers live only weeks. We will investigate if membrane composition can explain the longevity difference between birds and mammals, and examine if manipulation of dietary fat can extend the lifespan of worker bees.",University of Wollongong,Prof AJ Hulbert; A/Prof WA Buttemer,NSW

DP0879293,2007,2008,Transcriptional control of antigenic variation in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum,Long-term malaria infection by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum results from a process called antigenic variation wherein the parasite modifies its appearance to avoid the host's immune response. Each parasite possesses many different var genes but uses only one at a time. Antigenic variation occurs when parasites switch between the var gene used. We will investigate the basic mechanisms of var gene switching. Knowledge gained could be used to develop drugs that interfere with antigenic variation and prevent malaria parasites escaping the host's immune response. Our discoveries would also contribute to the understanding of antigenic variation in other parasites that infect animals and humans in Australia.,The University of Melbourne,Dr MF Duffy; Prof GV Brown,Vic

Past research shows that most such children have poor knowledge of relationships between letters and their sounds. But no one knows what causes poor letter-sound knowledge, or whether poor letter-sound knowledge causes poor reading. We will find this out by testing if training poor phoneme processing improves poor letter-sound knowledge, and if training poor letter-sound knowledge improves reading. Our outcomes will reduce the number of Australian children who suffer academically, socially, and emotionally because they cannot learn to read.",Macquarie University,Dr G McArthur; Prof M Coltheart; Prof AE Castles,NSW

Genes with these repeats, ""Contingency genes"", are randomly switched on and off. This process, 'phase variation', generates diversity in a population. Recently we described a new class of contingency gene that methylates DNA. On/off switching of this gene leads to random switching of multiple genes; the 'phasevarion'. Regulation by methylation is common in higher organisms. Finding this process in bacteria is a paradigm shift discovery.

Latent variable systems potentially can provide complementary and new information about underlying constructs like preferences for 'comfort,' 'convenience', 'quality', 'value for money', etc.. We focus on estimating variance components associated with various design elements, latent variables and covariates because choice model parameters covary with choice variability. Consequently, one needs to model systematic, non-constant variability in choices. Latent variable systems offer new ways to analyse this variability in choice experiments and provide new insights about consumer preferences.","University of Technology, Sydney",Prof JJ Louviere; Dr CM Rungie; A/Prof LV Coote,NSW

Governments consider these people to be migrants first, and workers second, and limit their access to basic labour rights accordingly. Until recently, civil society organisations, too, dealt with these foreigners as migrants - but now this has changed. This project traces a fundamental shift in civil society responses since NGOs and international labour bodies began involving local unions in migrant worker issues.

One aspect of this debate that requires greater understanding is the ecological role that the megafauna played in the environment, and how the mammal community was altered following the extinctions. This proposal addresses this issue using new, innovative methods for assessing diet and community structure published by my collaborators and me this year in Nature. This established the relationship between complexity of mammal teeth and the diet of the species.

A solution is capture and storage of the CO2. This is feasible if coal is burned in oxygen rather than air, so the exhaust gas does not contain nitrogen. To control temperatures, CO2 is recycled and mixed with the oxygen. Thus the hot combustion gas is very rich in CO2 plus water vapour (from burning coal volatiles). CO2 is very corrosive, but very little is known of the reactivity of CO2+H2O gases. This project will investigate reactions between these gases and alloys, and ways of controlling their rates.",The University of New South Wales,Prof DJ Young; Dr J Zhang,NSW

Although intuitively appealing, this theory is highly controversial as genetic variance in sexually-selected traits should be depleted.  Recent advances in multivariate quantitative genetics have confirmed that male sexually selected traits lack genetic variance.  We will test the hypothesis that female choice against novel deleterious mutations prevents the accumulation of genetic variance while still providing a genetic benefit to choosing females, providing a mechanism for the maintenance of female choice in natural populations.",The University of Queensland,Prof MW Blows; Dr KL McGuigan,Qld

DP0880374,2007,2008,"With or without pots: Investigating the archaeology of human settlement on Santa Isabel, western Solomon Islands","The human prehistory of the Solomon Islands is not adequately understood.  While a few of the islands have experienced extensive archaeological research, the majority have received only cursory glances.  As a result there are currently several competing hypotheses for explaining human colonisation and cultural development, specifically the limited distribution of Lapita Cultural Complex sites of the mid- to late-Holocene period.  A recent archaeological pilot study on Santa Isabel in the western Solomons has provided exciting new evidence to address this long-standing debate.

DP0880386,2007,2008,Structured Moral Pluralism,"The best-known moral theories advocate one fundamental principle of morality. Critics object that a single-foundation theory cannot capture everything that is morally significant. Yet the pluralistic alternatives, which base morality on multiple foundations, can seem vague and uninformative. They lack explanatory power, because they lack structure. This project develops a structured pluralistic theory that overcomes this problem. It explains in detail a range of interactions between moral reasons, beyond simple 'balancing', and offers a degree of precision and rigour that pluralistic theories typically lack. A major aim is to show that this has important practical, and not only theoretical, implications.",The University of Adelaide,Prof GM Cullity,SA

The critical role of dispersal has stimulated considerable efforts to measure connectivity between local populations.  The prevalent approach, which focuses on predicting movement of dispersers, assumes that successful establishment of propagules is independent of their origin or dispersal history.  We propose that costs of dispersal, particularly the risk of colonists being maladapted, declines in condition during dispersal, and a reduction in colonist density, are significant, and act to reduce connectivity, particularly for more distant populations.

Three experiments, framed in a current speech perception model, PAM, examine (a) how phonological and phonetic properties of native prosodic systems influence the non-native tone perception, (b) how listeners assimilate non-native tones to their native prosodic categories, and (c) how native systems alter listeners' perception of prosodic structures. This would be the first study to investigate the issue and to expand PAM's coverage from speech segments to suprasegmentals (tones). Results imply the perception of non-native tones is constrained by one's native prosodic system.",University of Western Sydney,Dr CK So,NSW

DP0881261,2007,2008,The prevalence and cross-cultural comparison of daytime sleepiness in adolescents,"Overseas research shows that up to 60% of adolescents experience excessive daytime sleepiness due to insufficient sleep. The first aim of this project is to evaluate the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and delayed sleep phase in Australian adolescents. Chronic sleep deprivation during the school week and catching up on sleep on the weekends can cause a delay of their circadian rhythm, resulting in sleep problems, subsequent daytime sleepiness, poor school performance, and psychological problems. The second aim of the project is to make a direct cross-cultural comparison of irregular adolescent sleep patterns between Australia and the United States.",The Flinders University of South Australia,Prof L Lack; Dr M Gradisar; Dr HR Wright; Prof MA Carskadon,SA
DP0881263,2007,2008,Mitochondrial targeting of the DNA repair protein BARD1,"We aim to characterise intracellular transport of the DNA repair protein, BARD1. BARD1 is normally positioned in the nucleus, moving to DNA repair sites when DNA is damaged. We recently detected BARD1 at mitochondria and hypothesise that BARD1 mitochondrial transport is regulated by signalling events, such as DNA damage. We will investigate how BARD1 is recruited to mitochondria, define the mitochondrial sub-compartment to which it locates, and determine its regulation by the DNA damage response proteins BRCA1 and p53. This study will shed light on how the cellular response to DNA damage is mediated by changes in protein trafficking. ",The University of Sydney,Dr BR Henderson; Dr H Rizos,NSW

Observation of positron binding is a long standing goal of experimental positron physics and has been hampered by the lack of high resolution positron beam sources.  A new high resolution positron beam has recently been constructed in Australia, and will be used to measure high resolution ( about 10 meV), low energy (0-20 eV) total, elastic and positronium formation cross sections for positron scattering from selected atoms and molecules, in search for the signature of positron bound states.",The Australian National University,Dr C Makochekanwa,ACT
DP0881279,2007,2008,Constructing a temporally-constrained palaeoecological model of Quaternary faunal evolution and extinction in eastern Australia,"Debate over the extinction of Australia's late Quaternary large-sized terrestrial animals (megafauna) has become polarised in recent years, with the cause(s) traditionally pinned on either natural climate change or anthropogenic influences (e.g., over-hunting). Such controversy is partially due to the paucity of detailed fossil records with firm chronological control. This project will use a multidisciplinary approach to produce a reliable geochronological and palaeoecological framework for fossil records in eastern Australia. Results of this study will allow us to examine, with high precision, the fate of megafauna, their response to prehistoric environmental stresses, and the role of human and/or natural climate factors in extinction.",The University of Queensland,Dr GJ Price,Qld
DP0881291,2007,2008,An investigation of long-range stereopsis," Stereoscopic vision, based on differences in the two eyes' views, is regarded as the most important cue to perceived depth but useful only at close distances. Geometric calculation however suggests that large depths should be discriminable stereoscopically up to a kilometre away. This project takes up the unexplored area of how depths are  perceived at medium to large distances using computer controlled LEDs as targets. We also explore for the first time stereo slant and curvature perception at these  distances and the role of the ground plane and other cues in scaling the depth magnitude perceived from image differences.

We use evolutionary model systems in the wild to complement model system lab studies of free radical biology, a major aspect of current senescence theory. We assess the production and maintenance of levels of Reactive Oxygen Species and other reactive metabolic by-products of respiration as selection pressures in natural populations. We then employ quantitative genetics and selection analysis to examine, surprisingly for the first time, whether free radicals can drive evolutionary processes in the wild.",University of Wollongong,Prof MM Olsson; Dr E Wapstra,NSW

By exploiting graph coloring and exploring perfect graphs for data aggregates for the first time, we will produce allocation algorithms that are elegant, effective and practical for embedded programs. The outcomes of this project will be embedded software tools that promise to take much the burden of scratchpad management from the embedded programmer, which is time-consuming, error-prone and inevitably leads to sub-optimal solutions for large programs.",The University of New South Wales,Prof J Xue,NSW

DP0881338,2007,2008,The prediction of sleep/wake behaviour based on physiological and social factors.,"Sleep is important for all people because it gives us an opportunity to recover from, and prepare for, being awake. Traditional models of sleep/wake behaviour consider sleep to be determined primarily by physiological factors such as length of previous sleep, duration of wakefulness and time-of-day. However, recent evidence suggests that sleep is also determined by other factors such as work, family and social commitments. The aim of this project is to examine the influence of all these factors on sleep, and develop algorithms to accurately predict people's sleep/wake behaviour. These algorithms could be incorporated into a mathematical model to estimate the level of fatigue associated with irregular work schedules.",University of South Australia,Dr GD Roach; Dr J Dorrian,SA

Coevolution of pathogen and host has been aptly described as a genetic ""arms race"" employing various key proteins expressed by both prokaryote and eukaryote cells.  As the prokaryote cell evolves to evade the host defences, the host evolves in parallel to thwart these efforts.  The over-riding aim of this project is to draw upon the wealth of microbial genome sequence data to investigate the mechanisms of evolution amongst different bacterial pathogens.  A primary focus is the role of positive ""Darwinian"" selection in the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis.",The University of Queensland,Dr SA Beatson,Qld

I have found similar parallels in insects, suggesting that the gland and nervous systems are developmentally linked in both insects and mammals. If this holds true, the fruit fly could be an informative model for understanding diseases associated with gland malfunction such as intestinal metaplasia. I will use the powerful genetic approaches available in the fruit fly to determine the genes involved in gland formation and establish whether the developmental pathways are similar to the fly's sensory system, and to the human nervous system.

Examples include labour contracts, utility tariffs, and tax codes. Since most real life environments are complex, the assumption of rational behaviour on the part of individuals, which permeates most work in the area of the theory of contracts, is at a best a crude approximation of reality. We propose to relax this assumption and assume that economic agents do make mistakes, though more costly mistakes are less likely. The aim is to build formal models of such boundedly rational behaviour and use them to address the question of optimal contract design. The results can be applied, for example, to devising better labour contracts and improving the tax codes.",La Trobe University,Dr S Basov; Dr MI Bhatti,Vic

DP0881537,2007,2008,Choice and Classification in  complex and adversarial environments,"Mechanism Design (MD) is design of policy that takes account of economic agents' incentives to strategically manipulate. Theoretical  development of MD however largely ignores practical constraints  for monitoring behavior. For instance, in  many real world situations,  monitoring occurs using sophisticated statistical machine learning models discussed in computer science (CS)  - scoring by credit agencies for example. Here, we constrain monitoring strategies to be such algorithms.  Monitoring a population  of individuals  or a similarly constrained large adversary is then addressed.   Notable cross disciplinary implications exist for ""concept drift"" and ""adversarial classification"", two key issues in the CS classification problem.

DP0881548,2007,2008,Pore scale characterisation of the wettability of petroleum reservoir core material: Towards optimised recovery of hydrocarbon reserves,"A primary cause of poor recovery of hydrocarbons from oil reservoirs is lack of knowledge regarding the wettability state of the rock. This project aims to understand the reasons for suboptimal recovery by characterising both the structure of reservoir core at the pore scale in 3D using x-ray microtomographic imaging, and its wettability using multiphoton microscopy. This information will be incorporated into state-of-the-art network modelling software to predict recovery and relative permeability in cores, with predictions verified by direct comparison with experiment.

DP0881848,2007,2008,Development of high-throughput in silico methods for protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography,"The most common method in the structure determination of proteins using x-ray crystallography is Molecular Replacement (MR), which relies on structural information from proteins that share sequence similarity with the target protein. However, MR is non-trivial when the sequence similarity is less than 30%, and the selection of a suitable starting model is onerous due to inherent model error.  We have developed a method, employing objective pruning of multiply aligned structures, that produces superior candidate models for structure elucidation.  This will result in a major new tool to solve the three-dimensional structures of proteins in a significantly shorter timeframe than is currently possible.

LP0882083,2007,2008,An Empirical Examination of Non-Market Capitalisation Weighted Indices in Australia,"Hundreds of billions of dollars are invested using capitalisation weighted indices in Australia. A novel approach, fundamental indexation, challenges the long held academic view that such indexation is optimal. Our study investigates the claim that superior risk-adjusted returns are possible with fundamental indexation. It would be the first, outside the US, to test this claim. If superior performance, which is robust across various time periods and business cycles, is attainable then this may have profound implications for the Australian funds management industry. Re-investment of thousands of billions of dollars to Fundamental Indexation may be justified, leading to better retirement outcomes for millions of people in Australia.",Monash University,Dr MJ Dempsey; Prof RW Faff; A/Prof PR Lajbcygier; A/Prof M Veeraraghavan; Dr LS Irlicht; Mr L de Bever,Vic

LP0882329,2007,2008,Developing negotiation decision support systems that promote constructive relationships following disputes,"Most negotiation support systems focus upon meeting the needs of disputants rather than emphasizing just settlements or concentrating upon the development of constructive relationships following the resolution of a dispute.  Nevertheless, in both body corporate and family disputes involving children, the protagonists inevitably need to deal with each other once the conflict has abated.  

Hence Relationships Australia and Victoria Body Corporate have approached the chief investigators to help with the development of appropriate negotiation support systems.

Such systems as well as a generic Online Dispute Resolution Environment will be developed, evaluated and reconfigured.

Apples are one of the main contributors to flavonoid intake in many populations. There is mounting evidence that flavonoid-rich foods protect against cardiovascular disease as well as other diseases and disorders. To date, there has been no systematic attempt to select for high-flavonoid fruit in a conventional breeding program. Therefore, our aim is to identify progeny of both the apple and plum breeding program that have elite levels of flavonoids and to demonstrate health benefits of a flavonoid-rich apple. The introduction of a flavonoid-rich apple would be a small change which could have a significant impact on the risk of cardiovascular disease and other diseases and disorders.",The University of Western Australia,Dr JM Hodgson; Prof KD Croft; Dr M Considine; Dr SC Tan,WA

LP0884103,2007,2008,Evaluating a biogeochemical mechanism for soil anomaly formation using diffusive thin-film samplers in geochemical exploration,"Soil geochemical anomalies may form by plant uptake of trace metals at depth, and deposition during biological cycling. If so, vegetation will generate a transient pool of metal ions in surface soils, even if no soil anomaly is detectable by conventional analysis. The diffusive gradients-thin films technique (DGT) can determine this metal ion pool since it both pre-concentrates in situ, and is observed to closely mimic plant uptake. We will therefore provide evidence to evaluate a biogeochemical hypothesis for anomaly genesis.

DP0770420,2006,2007,Wavelet approaches for solving nonlinear dynamic systems in process engineering,"Many industrial processes, such as pharmaceutical manufacturing and mineral processing, are described by nonlinear dynamical systems. These systems play an important role in the advancement of industrial systems and technology. Analytical tools, however, frequently are inadequate for their solutions. Such a restriction makes impossible any long term predictions which might be sought. This project will provide a new wavelet-based numerical method for solving nonlinear systems arising from process engineering. The appropriate solution of these problems will enhance control implementations for improved process operations. The project will also make contributions to basic and fundamental research in the area of differential equations.",Curtin University of Technology,Dr T Zhang,WA

DP0771432,2006,2007,Ferroelectric - ferromagnetic tunnel junctions,"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the behaviour of ferroelectric-ferromagnetic multilayered thin film structures. By creating a sandwich structure of a spinel metal oxide(ferromagnetic) and an ultra-thin perovskite (ferroelectric), we will fabricate a heterostructure that is responsive to both magnetic as well as electric bias. This provides a basis for innovative materials with striking properties. State of the art deposition facilities will be used to generate these structures. Characterisation will include analysis through advanced scanning probe microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy.",The University of New South Wales,Dr N Valanoor; Prof PR Munroe; Dr TC Petersen; Dr H Kohlstedt,NSW
DP0771453,2006,2007,Study of mathematical models of evolution using the theory of quantum games - strengthening the theoretical foundation of quantum computation,"Evolutionary quantum games (EQGs) are emerging as a significant research activity in the field of quantum game theory. EQGs potentially provide a novel approach to modelling of nanosystems, especially nano-self-assembled systems. The study of decoherence in a game-theoretic framework is of particular significance in EQGs, as a whole 'population' is engaged in quantum interactions. This project aims to elucidate and improve understanding of the role of decoherence in EQGs. That is, to use the population setting of quantum evolutionary game theory in order to develop a new game-theoretic approach, which will ultimately benefit the modelling of nanosystems and nano-self-assembled systems.

DP0771492,2006,2007,Understanding forms of violence and their regulation in Australian history,"Violent crime, violence in everyday life, and the violence of institutional practices seen as forms of abuse preoccupy the public culture of modern Australia. This project undertakes a set of related investigations into the history of Australian responses to violence and its associated impacts. What have been the achievements in controlling violence as a social behaviour and limiting its use as an instrument of power? Planned research outputs will include two monographs and related articles on the history of the government of violence in Australia.",Griffith University,Prof MJ Finnane,Qld

This project will analyse the birth, diffusion and effectiveness of the common package of regulations formulated to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. International organisations have successfully defined the nature of these policy problems, and designed and diffused the regulatory response world-wide by socialising and occasionally coercing states. The project will resolve current uncertainties about the impact and success of these regulations using a multi-method analysis.",The University of Sydney,Dr J Sharman,NSW
DP0771619,2006,2007,Community and identity in post-war European philosophy,This project will expound and evaluate the political notions of community and identity in post-war European philosophy. It asks how Heidegger's philosophical legacy has been appropriated and what truth there is to the claim of Heidegger's political romanticism. At stake is an alternative to both fascism and liberalism. A new concept of community that is philosophically grounded and responsive to the dangers of both chauvinism and globalisation can be shown to arise.,The University of New South Wales,Dr JA Phillips,NSW
DP0771627,2006,2007,Spatio-temporal modelling of Ras dependent MAP kinase activation,"The major aim of the project is to develop novel mathematical models that yield deep insights into cellular signal transduction pathways. This involves designing a simulation framework that uses both stochastic and deterministic processes to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of complex biological systems. It will be the first time that the spatial heterogeneity of a cell is fully realized in mathematical models of signalling pathways. Hybrid models for biochemical reactions in different subcellular and membrane compartments will enable us to rationalize the interpretation of recent experimental data sets. In addition, testable predictions from realistic mathematical models will identify new directions for experimental discovery.",The University of Queensland,Prof JF Hancock; Dr T Tian,Qld

These supermassive black holes are thought to be the fossil remnants of quasars which have been observed over 90% of the universes age. However the origin and evolution of supermassive black holes remains a mystery. This Discovery Project will examine the formation of supermassive black holes, as well as the ways in which their evolution is traced by the quasar population.  Black holes represent a fascinating topic for prospective students.

Such software includes Internet search engines, medical diagnosis systems and bioinformatics systems. We propose an in-depth study of metamorphic testing to enhance the failure-detection capability of testing without an oracle. Besides identifying useful metamorphic relations, we shall integrate our approach with other techniques in test case selection, fault-based testing and symbolic execution, with a view to developing a more comprehensive testing methodology.

Notwithstanding these difficulties there have been few empirical studies of experts in and around courts. This project offers the first sustained and comparative ethnographic study of expert evidence. It will provide a platform for evaluating recent procedural reforms and assessing the roles played by experts and expert evidence in different jurisdictions. It aims to identify means of enhancing the provision and evaluation of expert advice in order to improve access to the courts, the accuracy of legal decision making and public confidence in our legal institutions.",The University of New South Wales,Dr G Edmond,NSW
DP0771800,2006,2007,Managing trust: a comparative historical study of political accountability in Australia.,"This study breaks new ground by examining the construction and management of political trust in specific historical contexts. Recent scholarship has identified a worrying decline of political trust in established democracies. This scholarship lacks historical depth, basing its assumptions on opinion surveys. By comparing the trust relationship between electors and politicians at two points in Australian history, 1929-1933 and 1968-1978,the study investigates the assumptions of this scholarship. It tests the hypothesis that trust is constantly remade and that its meaning shifts between different historical contexts. The project will advance understandings of the nature of political trust in Western democracies.",The University of Melbourne,Dr J Dickenson,Vic

This project will investigate the role of the subduction zone geometry in determining the rate of such migration and in generating great earthquakes. Insight will be obtained from kinematic calculations for all subduction zones on Earth and geodynamic simulations. Outcomes will include new insight into the geodynamics of subduction zones surrounding the Australian continent, the required physical ingredients to generate great earthquakes and the definition of a new Earth reference frame for plate tectonics.",The Australian National University,Dr WP Schellart,ACT

The satellite will be the first to detect Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. It measures the tiny dip in stellar brightness caused by a planet as it moves in front of the parent star. The APD will develop sophisticated processing algorithms and use novel techniques to characterise the planet-hosting stars via ultra-precise time-resolved brightness measurements. This will provide exquisite details about the interiors of the stars and reveal the sizes, temperatures and orbits of the planets. The results will provide strong conclusions on theories of stellar physics and planet formation, and determine if planets like Earth are common around Sun-like stars.",The University of Sydney,Mr D Stello,NSW

In insect systems roles for these enzymes in hormone synthesis and insecticide detoxification have been established.  Using modern genetic and biochemical strategies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, this project will identify the specific cytochrome P450s responsible for important developmental processes including the synthesis/degradation of the major insect hormones ecdysone and juvenile hormone.

DP0772078,2006,2007,Methodologies for Designing and Evaluating Information Retrieval Experiments,"Information retrieval research is primarily concerned with two aspects of how a system such as a web search service performs: its efficiency, and its effectiveness.  Effectiveness relates to the quality of the results that a service provides, compared to other services with access to the same data. For example, recall and precision are often used as effectiveness measures. In contrast, efficiency is concerned with how quickly the data can be queried. In this project we examine the techniques used to assess effectiveness and efficiency of search systems, with a view to providing novel metrics that better reflect the underlying utility provided by search systems, and allow more useful and informative comparisons between systems.",The University of Melbourne,Prof AM Moffat; Prof J Zobel,Vic
DP0772191,2006,2007,Two-Dimensional Semantics and the Foundations of Philosophy,"When you speak, you know what you're saying. How do you manage that trick? Traditionally, philosophers have insisted that this ability is grounded in apriori knowledge - knowledge that's independent of experience. Recent developments in logic have led to a highly sophisticated version of this view: two-dimensional semantics. Australian philosophers have been the most powerful advocates of this new, apriori conception of linguistic knowledge. We reject this approach. This project develops an alternative model of meaning, which explains how rational inquiry is possible without the apriori foundations posited by 2D semantics.

DP0772238,2006,2007,Discovering justified knowledge from data,"Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD) has become a critical tool for science, commerce and public administration.  However, its effectiveness is reduced by the propensity of some key techniques to make many spurious as well as real 'discoveries.'  Such false discoveries can be misleading and extremely costly.  Standard statistical techniques designed to address this problem do not directly scale-up to the massive numbers of potential discoveries that KDD routinely explores: their power is too low, and their computational requirements too high.  This project will develop efficient and effective technologies to control the risk of false discoveries from those susceptible techniques, thereby greatly increasing the value and reliability of KDD.",Monash University,Prof GI Webb,Vic

My recent work on EEG activity at stimulus onset has demonstrated 'preferred' brain states - particular phases of very narrow EEG bands occur substantially more often than expected by chance. These preferred states have been shown to facilitate stimulus processing. Existing data collected for other purposes will be re-examined using the innovative data-processing techniques developed in my research. After replicating, extending and optimising aspects of the data processing in normal groups, its utility will be tested by investigating brain dynamics in populations expected to demonstrate very different variants in brain dynamics.",University of Wollongong,Prof RJ Barry,NSW

It will explore ways to exploit these properties to produce powders with enhanced flowability. Key outputs will include scientific instruments and test protocols to measure multi-component diffusion coefficients, solids segregation and cohesive-stickiness. Physical models/predictive tools will be developed to optimise the amount of protein used.

DP0772276,2006,2007,"The Empire of New Idealism?: Civilisation and Australian New Idealism, 1850-1950","When Australia emerged as a nation in 1901, it had already found its own distinctive philosophical voice in the global community. That philosophy sought ideals of, above all, global freedom and unity. This project tracks the emergence of that voice after the introduction of 'British Idealist' philosophy in the mid-nineteenth century and seeks to illuminate its shaping role in public discussions and policy on Federation, citizenship and civilisation. The project's assessment of the impact of British philosophy in Australia, and then the reverse, will challenge the conventional portrayal of British Idealism as a 'colonising philosophy' and serve as the trigger for the globalisation of New Idealist studies.",Macquarie University,Dr M Hughes-Warrington; Dr I Tregenza; Prof D Boucher; Dr S Helgeby,NSW

Did they understand their identity as distinctively 'European' and hostile to the larger society which surrounded them? How were they understood by others? Anchored in a thorough social historical investigation of European communities in Turkey, Syria, Egypt and the Maghreb, this project draws upon largely untapped French, English and Arabic sources to propose that these communities were not simply stalking-horses for the colonial domination of the following century, but a rich source of social and cultural interaction between Europe and Islam, of urgent relevance for today's plural societies.",The University of Melbourne,Mr I Coller,Vic

We compare infant and toddlers' responses to words spoken in the ambient dialect versus 4 other English dialects, in which the words vary systematically in their phonetic details and/or in their phonological form.  The dialects differ from Australian in consonants, vowels, prosody, or all three dimensions. The findings will reveal how young language learners use details of native speech to uncover the abstract linguistic structure in their native language, and explicate the vital link between experiential tuning in infant speech perception and early words.",University of Western Sydney,Prof CT Best; Dr CM Kitamura; Prof G Docherty; Prof W Labov,NSW

Invertebrates must solve the same problem, but on a tiny scale, and with very modest computational resources - the same constraints we face in designing autonomous robots. Jumping spiders have a unique modular system in which separate pairs of eyes are used for detailed shape perception and motion detection.

Departing from that view, this project investigates a new intellectual-historical hypothesis: namely, that the 'moment of theory' represents the return of an old but still-powerful intellectual tradition, European university metaphysics, but as a practice of self-cultivation rather than as a doctrine. Delivering its results in a series of articles and a major monograph, the project promises to transform our understanding of contemporary humanities theory by showing its institutional indebtedness to metaphysics as a mode of intellectual self-culture.",The University of Queensland,Prof IR Hunter,Qld

Understanding the impact of human modifications, including land-use and climate change, is vital for successful management of this resource. This study will quantify, spatially and temporally, the impact of human modification on the hydrology and meteorology of the basin.  Via an improved understanding of the sensitivity of the hydrometeorology to change, this research will identify areas within the basin that, if modified, will have the greatest impact on the hydrometeorology of other parts of the basin.

Decoupling natural variability from human influence using isotopes,"Theoretical and statistical evidence suggests that humans may be responsible for an increase in the destructiveness and intensity of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years. Others suggest this is a natural oscillation. Present approaches will take at least another 20-30 years to resolve this issue. We will provide a more immediate answer using long-term, high-resolution isotope records of tropical cyclones in calcite stalagmites for several of the world's ocean basins. This technique is superior to long-term sedimentary records of this hazard because it registers a broad intensity spectrum of events.

These properties are caused by unique deformation mechanisms that are not assessable by coarse-grained materials. The deformation mechanisms in nanostructured materials are not well understood, which in turn severely hinders the design and optimization of nanostructured materials with superior mechanical properties for practical applications.

Self-normalized limit theorems put a totally new countenance upon the classical limit theorems. The results in this area are more natural because they waive the unknown parameters but also they are valid under minimal moment conditions, and hence are of fundamental mathematical importance.

By resolving how communities responded to climate changes before and immediately after human arrival, it will give a much clearer picture of the timing and causes of these extinctions. This will provide essential background data for better managing our modern fauna in view of the potentially negative effects of global warming.",The Flinders University of South Australia,Dr GJ Prideaux,SA

Phosphite is used to control the pathogen in natural ecosystems but is considered a 'stop-gap approach', since it interferes with the P-starvation response in plants.  Our working hypothesis is that a modification in the signal-transduction pathway between sensing the internal P status and down-regulation of P-uptake capacity has weakened the defence response against P. cinnamomi. A thorough understanding of the interactions between phosphite and plant P nutrition in determining susceptibility to P. cinnamomi will lead toward new strategies to combat this devastating phytopathogen.",The University of Western Australia,Prof JT Lambers; A/Prof GE Hardy; Dr PM Finnegan; Dr SJ Barker; A/Prof B Dell; Dr PA O'Brien; Dr M Tibbett; Dr G Yan; Dr S Barrett; Dr IJ Colquhoun; Dr BL Shearer; Mr N Sibbel; Dr MA Smith; Mr Z Spadek,WA

There is a need for robust feedback control design methods for quantum systems that are capable of achieving desired performance while compensating for the detrimental effects of uncertainty, decoherence and noise, and taking into account the fact that measurements affect the dynamics of quantum systems. Standard control methods do not take into account the special features of quantum systems; these features, however, are critical to the operation of these systems and provide opportunities beyond those available  in classical systems. This project will address  these challenges by developing a new theory of robust feedback control for quantum systems.",The University of New South Wales,Prof IR Petersen; Prof MR James,NSW

When these materials are restricted to ultra-thin dimensions there arises an enormous depolarizing field. The additional electrostatic energy created by the depolarizing field must be minimized which drives in the thin film a phase transition. Both electrostatic and mechanical boundary conditions play a critical role in such phase transitions.
